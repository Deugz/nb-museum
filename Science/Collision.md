## Bouncing barrier

### Growth mechanism

Particles are coupled to the gas (Orbiting at Keplerian speed) and this is what drives the relative speed of &micro;m dust grains (ie more or less head wind relative to their size). Dust orbits the protostar at very high velocities but the relative velocities between particles in collisions can be very slow (few cm or a few mm per second). At such velocities a “bouncing barrier” exists {cite:p}`Zsom2010`. Up to mm sizes the sticking is dominated by <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Description">Van der Waals type forces</span>, leading to the formation of fluffy aggregates. Past the km scale, gravity dominates {cite:p}`Gutler2010`.

Those two figures comes from {cite:p}`Testi2014`


**models of grain growth** 

Alongside the size of the colliding particles the relative velocity is also important

## Collision Experiments

In the laboratory, a plethora of collision experiments have been conducted which clearly define the sticking bouncing and fragmentation regimes for small dusty particles at low velocities {cite:p}`Blum2010`. Those experiments, carried out with different dust composition (SiO2 / Carbon dust), have shown that in “pure dust” collisions, the dust material is less 
important than the **grain size, the surface roughness and porosity**.

- All of those could be investigated by SEM

- Lab is often in microgravity to reach low velocity while avoiding sedimentation {cite:p}`Blum2000` 

The outcomes of these collisions provide vital data to modellers who want to understand how collision properties and outcomes impact the broader processes of planet formation. [23] 

### Icy particles collision

Ice enhnaces the stickiness of interstellar grains {cite:p}`Gundlach2015`. No collisions between amorphous ice particles has been performed to date (even though they are present in PPD), the reason being the complex and metastable nature of amorphous ice which makes it difficult to produce, store and use. This is what I was trying to solve

## HGW ice grains 

I designed an experiment to produce Amorphous Ice grain analogues. HGW is similar to ASW.

### HGW Setup

The purpose of this experiment is to produce **&micro;m HGW ice particles**. This is achieved by spraying &micro;m water droplets in liquid ethane, the most suited cryoliquid to achieve high cooling rates. This is a technique used in cryobiologie to freeze biological samples.

```{note}

Hence, this setup could open the doors for sample preparation that extend far beyond the scope of astronomy! 

- Important to mention for business case

Initial Neutron scattering results show that our ices present some amorphicity.

#### SEM ?

Electron microscopy would be allow us to caracterise the particles shape and size distribution as well as unveiling the processes at play during the aggregation phase, like {cite:p}`Gundlach2018` 


### Ice manipulation

One of the most difficult aspect when dealing with amorphous ices is that when pulled out of their cold medium, they will very quicklywarm up and crystalise.

#### Inside Glove box

#### Prep chamber

#### Storage



#### Experimental limitations

- Particles need to remain at liquid nitrogen temperature or they will crystalise

- Ethane is present so may be best to have a prep lab in-house

## One Step further

```{note}

- Insert Accoustic trap video

```

#### From micron to mm-cm size amophous aggregates.

But this is only the first step toward unveiling the role that ASW could play in overcoming the bouncing barrier. Indeed, this barrier lies at sizes around the cm size and growing such big aggregates is another big challenge. 

We have developped at the OU an accoustic levitation technique that can work at temperature of -20 degree to allow for the aggregation of those monomers in a similar fashion than in space

Grain shape affect the IR spectral signature (ie right wing)
