### Collision Experiments

In the laboratory, a plethora of collision experiments have been conducted which clearly define the sticking bouncing and fragmentation regimes for small dusty particles at low velocities {cite:p}`Blum2010`. Those experiments, carried out with different dust composition (SiO2 / Carbon dust), have shown that in “pure dust” collisions, the dust material is less 
important than the **grain size, the surface roughness and porosity**.

- All of those could be investigated by SEM

- Lab is often in microgravity to reach low velocity while avoiding sedimentation {cite:p}`Blum2000` 

The outcomes of these collisions provide vital data to modellers who want to understand how collision properties and outcomes impact the broader processes of planet formation. [23] 



### Microgravity


### Icy particles collision

Ice enhnaces the stickiness of interstellar grains {cite:p}`Gundlach2015`. No collisions between amorphous ice particles has been performed to date (even though they are present in PPD), the reason being the complex and metastable nature of amorphous ice which makes it difficult to produce, store and use. This is what I was trying to solve

## HGW ice grains 

I designed an experiment to produce Amorphous Ice grain analogues. HGW is similar to ASW.
