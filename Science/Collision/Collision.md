#### <strong>Speed of colliding objects </strong>

Although the dust orbits the protostar at very high velocities (cf previous chapter), the relative dust velocities in collisions can be very slow – in the order of a few cm or a few mm per second at the earliest stages of planet growth.

To reach low velocity collision experiments needs to be performed in **microgravity**

#### <strong>Nature/Structure of the colliding object </strong>



In the laboratory, a plethora of collision experiments have been conducted which clearly define the sticking bouncing and fragmentation regimes for small dusty particles at low velocities {cite:p}`Blum2010`. Those experiments, carried out with different dust composition (SiO2 / Carbon dust), have shown that in “pure dust” collisions, the dust material is less 
important than the **grain size, the surface roughness and porosity**.

- All of those could be investigated by SEM

- Lab is often in microgravity to reach low velocity while avoiding sedimentation {cite:p}`Blum2000` 

The outcomes of these collisions provide vital data to modellers who want to understand how collision properties and outcomes impact the broader processes of planet formation. [23]

Those two figures comes from {cite:p}`Testi2014`


**models of grain growth** 

Alongside the size of the colliding particles the relative velocity is also important

### <strong>&#187;  <u> Icy particles collision </u></strong>


We know that in protoplanetary disks both crystalline {cite:p}`Terada2012` and amorphous {cite:p}`Smith1989` ice-coated dust grains are present at and beyond the snow line. However, whilst the amorphous icy layers predominantly are formed in pre-stellar cores via **chemical vapour deposition**, we now know that most of this chemical “knowledge” is lost as star formation progresses, and consequently by the time icy grains are incorporated into planet-forming disks around newly formed stars, the icy material has been desorbed, processed and re-adsorbed possibly several times [citation to extract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991Icar...94..333L/abstract). Therefore, the most representative amorphous ices of planet-forming icy grains are **vapour deposited** ASW {cite:p}`Aikawa2012` 

```{note}

What is difference between chemical vapour deposition and vapour deposition

Aikawa 2012 may not be a good ref,  check Deuterium fractionation papers

```

#### Ice collision properties

Ice enhnaces the stickiness of interstellar grains {cite:p}`Gundlach2015`. No collisions between amorphous ice particles has been performed to date (even though they are present in PPD), the reason being the complex and metastable nature of amorphous ice which makes it difficult to produce, store and use. This is what I was trying to solve



##### The difference between Ice and Dust

## HGW ice grains 

I designed an experiment to produce Amorphous Ice grain analogues. HGW is similar to ASW.
