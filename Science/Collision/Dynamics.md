## Planetesimals


- {cite:p}`Weidenschilling1980`: numerical model for computing simultaneous coagulation and settling (gravitational instability/non-Keplerian rotation of nebula), composite process forms km sized planetesimals




## Disk instabilities

- {cite:p}`Johansen2014`: hybrid model for planetesimal formation (particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals with a wide range of sizes)

## Overcoming The Bouncing Barrier

***
**2 Scenarios:**

- Gravitational instability
- Mass transfer

cf {cite:p}`Blum2014` for good introduction + Modelling and experiments on dust emission from comets etc., homogeneous layers of μm sized dust particles reach tensile strengths (103 – 104 Pa) far higher than water’s sublimation pressure, model of formation by gravitational instability leads to tensile strength of 1 Pa instead => could explain water driven comet activity (minimum size for dust-aggregates: ≈ 1 mm) => cometesimals must have formed by gravitational instability

### Gravitational collapse ?

{cite:p}`Aumatell2011`: Lab experiments, sublimation of freely levitating ice aggregates, frequent break up, sublimation of drifting ice aggregates might locally increase the density of small dust (silicate)

## Title

Let's jump over the Bouncing Barrier and have a look at thos km bodies that may have formed.


## Planetesimals


## Dynamic Evolution of the Early Solar System

{cite:p}`Nesvorny2018`


## Overcoming the bouncing barrier

### Electrical charging

- {cite:p}`Steinpilz2020`

## Growth Mechanism


### <strong> &#x2023; <u> Sintering ? </u></strong>

{cite:p}`Okuzumi2016` (mention ethane in their paper)

- {cite:p}`Sirono2011a`: Sintering increases strength of neck in aggregates, sintering region can span whole nebula

- {cite:p}`Sirono2011b`: Numerical simulations (sintering of icy dust aggregates), accumulation of fragments in particular region of protoplanetary nebula, planetesimal formation by gravitational instability




## Rocky Planet formation

{cite:p}`Burkhardt2021` : Two different scenarios for rocky planet formation





## From planet formation to planet atmosphere

{cite:p}`Molliere2022`
