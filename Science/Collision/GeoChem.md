```{admonition} To Do
:class: note, dropdown

- Insert a small paragraph about how we unveil the history of soloar systems via meteorites and Deuterium fractionation

- Finish this page as best I can and send to Ross for:
    - Comments
    - Ortograph Correction (lol, good luck with that)
    - Check if something can be said about D/H or O<sup>16</sup>/O<sup>18</sup>

- Rework the intro
    - Insert plan
- Make sure that the titles are correct

```

```{admonition} Ross
:class: tip, dropdown
Do all PPDs have rings ? Or is it a certain subset, does it require a bigger / smaller disk ? What proportion of observed PPD via ALMA are homogeneous ?
```
