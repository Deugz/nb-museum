### Spectral Energy Distribution


***

{cite:p}`Chiang1997`: Hydrostatic, radiative equilibrium disk models, disks encased by thin layer of superheated dust grains, result: disks flare & absorb more stellar radiation than flat disks would, spectral features from dust grains in superheated layer appear in emission if disk is viewed nearly face-on.

```{note}

Looks like good introduction

:::::{div} full-width

:::{grid-item}

A dusty envelope absorbs the stellar photons.

The dust grains re-emit thermal radiation (isotropically).

This dust emission is absorbed by other grains.

This process is reated until the photons escapes from the core.

Because the (radiative) energy is conserved, the temperature of the surface that  the observer sees is much lower than that of the star and the characteristic wavelength longer ("redder").

Within **dense core** ...


There is 2 parameters often used to describe the **SED** (Spectral Energy Distribution):
- Spectral index (class I, II, III)
- Bolometric temperature (class 0, I)
However, SEDs are way too complex to be characterised by a single number and their characterisation are inevitably coarse

First stage of planet formation. 
Not detectable in the near infrared.

Cold core emit like a `grey body`

:::{tab-item} Class 1

`````{grid}

````{grid-item}

Protostar begins to emerge and become detectable in the NIR (near Infrared).

Core is dispersing and punctuated by outflows 

SED dominated by FIR


`protostellar disk` to `protoplanetary disk` in 10<sup>4</sup> years (`ref 4 - 5`)
This process involve high temperature but while material is accreted by the star the disk mass and temperature decrease.

:::{tab-item} Class 2



Core has dissipated, the star has reached it's final mass and is now contracting. The star is now a Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS - ie T Tauri Star or HerbigAe depending on it's mass).

`Infrared excess` above photosphere, due to a protoplantary disks.

**Litterature**

:::

:::{tab-item} Class 3

Circumstellar disk has very little dust (optically thin) and little if any infrared excess.

SED looks like a stellar photosphere.
