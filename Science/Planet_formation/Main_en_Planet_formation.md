<div style="background-color:aliceblue;padding:25px;border-radius:20px;text-align:center;">
 
From the darkness of the void it came,<br>
A dust grain so small, without a name,<br>
Born in the depths of a molecular cloud,<br>
It swirled and twirled, floating about.

As time passed by, the dust grew more,<br>
And soon joined others, forming a core,<br>
Together they swirled in a cosmic dance,<br>
Spinning and twirling in a cosmic trance.

As the core grew, it formed a disk,<br>
A protoplanetary disk, so grand and brisk,<br>
The dust particles collided and stuck,<br>
Growing bigger and bigger, they were in luck.

The disk spun faster and faster still,<br>
And soon, the dust particles began to fill,<br>
The gaps and spaces between each other,<br>
Forming protoplanets, one after another.

From the darkness of the void, they emerged,<br>
Planets, so grand, and so diverged,<br>
Each with a unique story to tell,<br>
Of how they formed, in this cosmic carousel.

And so, the dust grain's journey was done,<br>
From a dark molecular cloud to a shining sun,<br>
A story of growth, of change, and wonders<br>
Of how we're all connected, from dust to brothers.
