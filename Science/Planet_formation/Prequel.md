It is commonly assumed by the public that appart from stars, our galaxy is empty, filled by void (as our eyes can see we we observe the night sky). And even though the vaccum we can achieve on Earth is higher than what we found in space, assuming that the medium between the stars (rightfully named the Interstellar Medium) is empty, is a big misconception.

The Big Bang produced all the Hydrogen (as well as Helium and Lithium) present today in the universe. The rest of the elements of the periodic table (called metal by Astronomers), up to iron (Z = 26), has been produced in the center of stars in a process called <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Hydrogen is burned in fusion reaction and heavier elements are produced as the star evolve">nucleosynthesis</span>. However, it is only when the star die in a massive explosion like supernovae, that those heavy elements are ejected throughout the Universe. We are now 14.6 Billion years post Big Bang and at the third generation of stars, galaxies have had time to form and they will be our host for the rest of this discussion. So what are galaxies made of ? Well, a supermassive Black hole at the center and then stars (may be solar systems) as far as our eyes can see, but this would be omitting the major constituent of the

:::{tab-item} Coronal Gas

Coronal gas, also known as coronal plasma, is a type of hot, highly ionized gas that is found in the outermost atmosphere of stars, known as the corona, that  is the source of the solar wind and of coronal mass ejections. It is characterized by its extremely high temperatures, typically around 1 to 10 million degrees Celsius. This is much hotter than the surface of the star, which is typically around 5,500 to 5,800 degrees Celsius for the sun. Coronal gas is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, as well as small amounts of other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The high temperatures of this gas cause the atoms to become <span class="hovertext" data-hover="They have lost one or more of their electrons">highly ionized</span>.

Coronal gas is a subject of ongoing research in astrophysics and heliophysics, as scientists try to understand how the corona is heated and how this relates to the solar wind and other solar activity

##  Interstellar Dust Grains

<p class="emphase"> We have seen that dust grains are present in the ISM and play a key role in it's evolution but what are they and how do they come from</p>

### <strong>&#x2023;  <u> Formation and evolution </u></strong>

Interstellar dust form through a combination of processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). One of them is the **condensation from the ejecta of evolved stars**. As stars come closer to the end of their lives, they often experience mass loss through winds and outbursts, which can lead to the formation of dust grains. We had a recent great example of such processes with the star Betelgeuse that is explain below:

<p class="emphase">B68 was first observed in 1785 by the great astronomers William Hershell, nonetheless he described it unapropriately as <br><br> " <strong> Hole in the sky </strong>" </p>

```{admonition} Woman in Science &#9888; - *Caroline Hershell*
:class: tip, dropdown
Caroline Hershell (his wife), was a much less famous but non less great scientist. It is thanks to a correspondance between her and her nephew that the discovery was revived after having fall into oblivion.  
```

Indeed, our dear William couldn't have been more wrong (yes, it happens to everybody, including the greatest) {cite:p}`Steinicke2016`. Molecular Clouds are full gus and dust particles like we have described abova and this it the reason why they obstruct the light of stars in the background, a process called **extinction**. It is a very important concept because most of our knowledge of interstellar dust is derived from the interaction of dust particles with electromagnetic radiation:
