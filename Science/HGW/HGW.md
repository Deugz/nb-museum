Hyperquenched Glassy Water

1 of the 5 polyamorphous form of amorphous water ice.

Obtained for the **extremely rapid** cooling of water dropplets. Different techniques are available to achieve that goal:

Left paragraph is an introduction to the *peers of the vitrification* process ... Before their time water was an issue for studying biological systems under a microscope because it evaporates in the vacuum of the
microscope. However 
- Freeze fracture 
- Freeze drying 
- Freeze substitution
were used but always resulted in dry specimens, hence removing insights into the hydrated state of biological samples.

```{note}

For nearly thirty years Fernandez-Moran was the active
advocate of cryo-electron microscopy (Fernandez-Moran, i960, 1985). In practice
the results were mediocre. It required the work of Nigel Unwin and his colleagues
at Cambridge, who introduced a whole new way of thinking towards electron
microscopy, and which resulted in the now historical article on catalase and purple
membrane (Unwin & Henderson, 1975), and that by Bob Glaeser and the
Berkeley group who first quantified beam damage (Glaeser, 1971), to put cryoelectron microscopy on its tracks. The break-through came in 1974, only a few
months after Parsons' group publication on catalase in water. Taylor & Glaeser
(1974) showed that, in the frozen state, the structure of catalase crystals can be
preserved to atomic resolution.

<p class="emphase">Water crystallizes upon cooling and ice is very different from liquid water</p>

**New ideas are needed **

- idea of vitrification (Luyet & Gehenio, 1940)

Abandonned because discovery of

- cryoprotecting effect of glycerol (Polge et al. 1949;

Idea that vitrification of water is impossible, only minimum growth can be achieved (insert Dubochet quote)

...

- Innsbruck {cite:p}`Bruggeler1980`
- Heidelberg {cite:p}`Dubochet1981`

In thin film method, dubochet confess that the proximity of the sample with a surface can have some influence (**definitely have for us**)

- **Homogeneous nucleation temperature**: T<sub>o</sub> - No absolute value (dependant on experimental conditions)
- **Glass Temperature**: T<sub>G</sub> viscosity of liquid water becomes so large that all rearrangements, including the formation of nuclei, are essentially stopped
- **Devitrification Temperature**: T<sub>V</sub>
- **Heterogeneous nucleation temperature**: T<sub>E</sub>

### <strong>&#187;  <u>Crystal growth </u></strong>


Once nucleation has occured, crystal growth occur very rapidly. However the process **release energy**, hence freezing cannot proceed to an end before the heat is dissipated.
- Crystal growth is therefore based on the dynamic equilibrium between heat production and dissipation at the crystal surface

```{note}
Presence of a **solute** changes the freezing conditions.
