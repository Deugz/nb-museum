   abstract = {Sintering is a process driven by mass transport that leads to the formation of a sinter neck between neighbouring particles. The temporal growth of the neck area can lead to an increase of the mechanical strength and increased heat conductivity of granular icy surfaces on Solar System bodies. For water ice, sublimation is closely connected to the sinter process, because it drives the mass transport from the particles in contact to their neck region. Here, we report on novel experiments conducted to investigate the sinter and the sublimation processes of micrometre-sized water-ice particles with the help of a cryogenically cooled scanning electron microscope. Based on these experiments, we developed a sinter model based on which the sintering influence on the tensile strength, the compressive strength, and the thermal conductivity of icy surfaces on Solar System objects can be derived. Applied to comets, we find that the sinter process is faster than the typical erosion rates of cometary surfaces, implying that the uppermost icy surface layers are thermally processed. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is warm enough to experience sintering during its lifetime, whereas the sinter time-scale of Saturn's moon Enceladus is longer than the age of our Solar System.},

   abstract = {(abridged) In the core accretion scenario for the formation of planetary rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although dust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of interstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and kilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the formation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in young extrasolar systems. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures are summarized. We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the initial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence for the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent evidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a brief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size distribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations. The observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models, in particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks. We also highlight the limits of current models, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains.},

   abstract = {We performed laboratory as well as microgravity experiments in which we studied the impact of small fractal aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized dust particles onto solid targets at various velocities. Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force Froll=1.2×10-9 N and for the break-up energy Ebr=1.3×10-15 J (valid for 1.9-μm-diameter SiO2 spheres) are used. Our experimental results suggest that aggregate restructuring in the solar nebula, and hence, the gradual increase of the fractal dimensionality of the dust agglomerates, becomes an important process when the aggregate diameters exceed a few centimeters. Dust aggregates below that size are not expected to be subjected to impact compaction. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {The formation of planetesimals, the kilometer-sized planetary precursors, is still a puzzling process. Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in proto-planetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Water ice is one of the most abundant materials in dense molecular clouds and in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials (e.g., silicates), water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have been scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-sized region and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup to grow aggregates composed of μm-sized water-ice particles, which we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at different temperatures between 114K and 260 K. We show with our experiments that for low temperatures (below ∼210 K), μm-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold velocity of 9.6 m s-1, which is approximately 10 times higher than the sticking threshold of μm-sized silica particles. Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities above 15.3 m s-1. A comparison of the experimentally derived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the presence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance the growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.},

   abstract = {Context. The sticking of micron-sized dust particles caused by surface forces within circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets. The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Aims. We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. Methods. We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous "phases" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom & Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. Results. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10-4during the simulations. Conclusions. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to π 1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {Context. The growth processes from protoplanetary dust to planetesimals are not fully understood. Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far, so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing. Aims. We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. Methods. We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Results. We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10-12and 102g and collision velocities in the range of 10-4$\ldots$ 104cm s-1for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. Conclusions. We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust. This collision model can be used for the determination of the dust-growth rate in protoplanetary disks. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},
