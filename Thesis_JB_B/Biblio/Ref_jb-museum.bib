   abstract = {The cooling efficiencies of various fluids at low temperature were compared by measuring the temperature decay in 3 μl water samples plunged into them. A simple model of cooling was used in order to discuss the results. Liquid ethane was found to produce a cooling rate of 660 K s−1, about twice that of liquid propane, while ethanol was almost as effective as ethane between 273 to 223 K. The heat‐transfer coefficient of liquid ethane was estimated to be between 1500 and 5000 W m−2 K−1, depending on the physical state assumed for the water sample. Samples of flagellated organisms, after being frozen rapidly in the above way, were freeze‐substituted by the method of Barlow & Sleigh (1979). Although this fixation did not give good definition of the microtubules of the flagellar axoneme, it exhibited reasonable tissue preservation in thin sections of the cell body. The fixation method resulted in preserved flagellar wave shapes, which were observed under the light microscope and in critical‐point dried cells examined by scanning and conventional electron microscopy. It was concluded (a) that methods for preserving the wave shape of the flagellum and for preserving its internal structure may not be compatible, and (b) that although the present cooling method (with ethane) approaches the speed required to arrest a flagellar wave, further improvements in the speed of the method are desirable. 1982 Blackwell Science Ltd},

   abstract = {The vitrification of pure liquid water by projecting a thin jet of liquid water at high speed into a liquid cryomedium is reported. The influence of the experimental parameters on the cooling rate and the devitrification of the jet-frozen vitrified material have been investigated. A structural difference between vitrified liquid water and amorphous solid water prepared from the vapour phase is inferred from a comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns. FINDING a method for vitrifying pure liquid water is important for several reasons. The investigation of vitrified liquid water will help to elucidate the structure of liquid water because the effects of thermal and static disorder can be largely separated 1-4. It might help in interpreting the anomalous properties of super-cooled waters-s. Vitrification of biological systems without cryo-protectants is another application that could enable studies to be made of morphology without freezing artefacts and of the mechanism of freezing damage 9 • 10 • When applied to dilute aqueous solutions complete vitrification means the simultaneous matrix isolation of dissolved species. This extends the well known matrix isolation from the gas phase 11 to nonvolatile solutes such as ionic systems or biomolecules and allows, among others, spectroscopic investigations at low temperatures in the dissolved state. Attempts to form vitreous ice by rapid cooling of liquid water have invariably led to formation of ice Ih (ref. 12). (Pryde and Jones 13 did report a heat capacity change of rapidly cooled water at 126 K which they attributed to a glass transition, but could not reproduce this result in subsequent experiments.) We have recently described the complete vitrification of liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions by jet-freezing of aqueous droplets distributed in n-heptane as an emulsion, where the combination of emulsification and high cooling rate was essential for vitrification 14 • We have since increased the cooling rate by orders of magnitude and report here the vitrification of pure liquid water without emulsification by injecting a thin fluid jet of liquid water at high pressures in vacuo into a liquid cryomedium. This is an extension of the jet-freezing method developed by Bachmann and Schmitt for freeze etching 15 • Our technique differs from that of splat-cooling on a cold metal surface by using a liquid cryomedium, and gives for liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions much higher cooling rates 14 • [It has been reported that D.

In contrast, the LFLs of the hydrocarbons increased when the pressure decreased from 1.0 to 0.1 atm, except for methane for which the LFL did not change with pressure. The adiabatic flame temperatures (AFTs) at the obtained LFL concentrations of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were also calculated at subatmospheric pressure conditions. The behaviors of the AFTs of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were similar to those of the LFLs under the influence of low pressures. On average, at initial pressures from 1.0 to 0.1 atm and LFL concentration, the AFT of hydrogen was 730 K, of the alkanes was 1900 K, and of ethylene was 1800 K.

   abstract = {Freeze etching of solute model systems (e.g., glycerol or ferritin solutions) demonstrates that cryofixation can introduce serious artifacts due to the segregation of the dissolved or dispersed material from the solvent. Since, in principle, this problem can be reduced by increasing the cooling rate, a new technique has been developed which combines spray freezing with freeze etching. This spray-freeze-etching is applied by first spraying the specimen into a liquid cryomedium. The frozen droplets are then "glued" together with butyl-benzene to form a regular freeze-etch specimen, while the temperature of the sample is kept at-850C. The results obtained by spray-freeze-etching are far superior to those obtained by standard freezing. Our results, using 5% glycerol as a test specimen, are equivalent to those obtained by the high-pressure method (1). The reduction of segregation during freezing makes freeze etching a method applicable for the investigation of solute systems. Furthermore, the study of unicellular organisms or cellular fractions by freeze etching without the use of antifreeze is made possible. ARTIFACT PROBLEMS IN CRYOFIXATION Since the introduction of freeze etching (2, 3), methods of adequate cryofixation for electronmicroscopic specimens have become of particular concern. In addition to offering an interesting alternative to chemical fixation for the study of cellular material, cryofixation provides practically the only method for the study of solute systems by electron micros-copy. Investigations of frozen-fluid specimens most clearly demonstrate the limits of cryofixation. The commonly available cooling rates are too low to prevent the rearrangement of solutes or particles during freezing. The well-known appearance of freeze-etched glycerol solutions is just one example. When frozen by the standard technique (by dropping a small metal specimen holder with about 1 mm3 of solution into a liquid cryomedium) the glycerol and water separate into two different phases, i.e., compartments of water surrounded by a glycerol network (Fig. 3). For a given cooling rate, the size of the water compartments depends on the glycerol concentration and on the presence of other solute materials. Similar pictures are obtained when freeze-etching aqueous solutions of salts or sugar (4), organic solutions (e.g., benzoic acid in benzene) (5), solutions of large molecules like high polymers (dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone) or proteins (albumin or ferritin) and even suspensions of larger particles (polystyrene latex, 0 < 0.1 jAm), segregate (5). When observed by freeze-etching, all these specimens show a wide network containing the solute material in high concentration and large areas containing mainly the solvent. 2149 Segregation can cause complex patterns, which might lead to misinterpretation of freeze-etched specimens. For instance, suspended particles (ferritin or latex) not only tend to agglomerate , but are often found arranged in a crystal-like pattern. Furthermore, when small particles (e.g., ferritin) and larger ones (polystyrene latex [0 = 0.3 Mum], yeast cells, etc.) are frozen together, the small particles are often observed on the surface of the larger ones, arranged in hexagonal patterns (5). The large objects merely act as mechanical obstacles against which the smaller particles are pushed by the advancing front of the growing ice crystal. Freeze-etching techniques for biological specimens use cryoprotectants that are mainly capable of preventing one very-gross form of segregation, namely, the formation of large ice crystals that cause cell damage. On the other hand, cryoprotectants might introduce artifacts of their own, either be segregation from the aqueous solution during freezing or by their toxic effects on the biological system. In investigations of solutions or colloidal systems, cryoprotectants are of no use at all. Therefore, several attempts have been made to increase the speed of freezing, which is known to improve the quality of a cryofixed electron-microscopic specimen (3, 6-9). When the extent of partitioning of freeze-etched dilute solutions was used as a criterion*, only two methods have demonstrated a significant improvement over the standard technique. One of them is the high-pressure method. Specimens are frozen under a high hydrostatic pressure (2000 atm) with optimum heat transfer. This method makes it possible to reduce the compartment size of 5% glycerol to about 10 nm (1, 10). The necessary freezing conditions can be obtained only with an elaborate apparatus, which is not yet commercially available. To overcome this difficulty, a spray-freezing method was developed, which can be applied to freeze-etching. Since this "spray-freeze-etch" method has previously been described only in a short note (11), the details of the procedure are given in this paper. THE TECHNIQUE OF SPRAY-FREEZE-ETCHING Principles The approach of the spray-freeze-etch technique is to increase the cooling rate by injection of very small droplets of the * It is recommended that different techniques should be evaluated by the use of simple model systems, such as glycerol solutions. Segregation patterns of solutions react very sensitively to changes in freezing conditions and are much easier to reproduce and interpret than freeze-etched cells.},

It has been difficult to explain the efficiency by which dust grains must have agglomerated to form planetesimals in circumstellar disks. A major obstacle is the fragility of aggregates, leading to collisional fragmentation, which makes it difficult for them to grow to, and beyond, meter-sized bodies. The distinct properties of cryogenic (5-100 K) amorphous water ice, which composes or coats the grains in the cooler parts of the nebulae (kJovian distances), may be able to account for the rapid agglomeration. Measurements are presented that show that this ice readily acquires persistent macroscopic electric dipoles, strongly enhancing grain-grain adhesion. In addition, measurements were made showing that vapor-deposited amorphous water ice is also highly mechanically inelastic (%10% rebound). Together these may explain this efficient net sticking and net growth. Similar properties of higher temperature grains may aid agglomeration in the inner regions of the nebulae.},

Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far, so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing. Aims. We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. Methods. We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Results. We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10-12and 102g and collision velocities in the range of 10-4$\ldots$ 104cm s-1for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. Conclusions. We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust.

   abstract = {Context. The sticking of micron-sized dust particles caused by surface forces within circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets. The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Aims. We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. Methods. We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous "phases" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom & Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. Results. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10-4during the simulations. Conclusions. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to π 1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {Water ice is one of the most abundant materials in dense molecular clouds and in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials (e.g., silicates), water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have been scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-sized region and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup to grow aggregates composed of μm-sized water-ice particles, which we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at different temperatures between 114K and 260 K. We show with our experiments that for low temperatures (below ∼210 K), μm-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold velocity of 9.6 m s-1, which is approximately 10 times higher than the sticking threshold of μm-sized silica particles. Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities above 15.3 m s-1. A comparison of the experimentally derived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the presence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance the growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.},

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in proto-planetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We performed laboratory as well as microgravity experiments in which we studied the impact of small fractal aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized dust particles onto solid targets at various velocities. Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force Froll=1.2×10-9 N and for the break-up energy Ebr=1.3×10-15 J (valid for 1.9-μm-diameter SiO2 spheres) are used. Our experimental results suggest that aggregate restructuring in the solar nebula, and hence, the gradual increase of the fractal dimensionality of the dust agglomerates, becomes an important process when the aggregate diameters exceed a few centimeters. Dust aggregates below that size are not expected to be subjected to impact compaction. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {(abridged) In the core accretion scenario for the formation of planetary rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although dust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of interstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and kilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the formation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in young extrasolar systems. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures are summarized. We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the initial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence for the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent evidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a brief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size distribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations. The observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models, in particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks. We also highlight the limits of current models, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains.},

   abstract = {Sintering is a process driven by mass transport that leads to the formation of a sinter neck between neighbouring particles. The temporal growth of the neck area can lead to an increase of the mechanical strength and increased heat conductivity of granular icy surfaces on Solar System bodies. For water ice, sublimation is closely connected to the sinter process, because it drives the mass transport from the particles in contact to their neck region. Here, we report on novel experiments conducted to investigate the sinter and the sublimation processes of micrometre-sized water-ice particles with the help of a cryogenically cooled scanning electron microscope. Based on these experiments, we developed a sinter model based on which the sintering influence on the tensile strength, the compressive strength, and the thermal conductivity of icy surfaces on Solar System objects can be derived. Applied to comets, we find that the sinter process is faster than the typical erosion rates of cometary surfaces, implying that the uppermost icy surface layers are thermally processed. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is warm enough to experience sintering during its lifetime, whereas the sinter time-scale of Saturn's moon Enceladus is longer than the age of our Solar System.},

   abstract = {Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is likely responsible for the diverse chemical compositions of chondrites and rocky planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. We present a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions of planetary building blocks that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it. The chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one where an element condenses when the mid-plane temperature in the disc is lower than the 50 per cent condensation temperature ($\rm T_\{50\}$) of that element and the other where the condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with some systematic differences of ∼10 per cent depending upon the radial distance and an element's condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling time-scale of the dust is of the order of the evolution time-scale of the disc or longer. If the decoupling time-scale is too short, the composition deviates significantly from the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the chemical compositions of chondrites, and ultimately the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, and may constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.},

   abstract = {The terrestrial planets and the asteroids dominant in the inner asteroid belt are water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have decreased below water-condensation level well before the disk was photo-evaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is puzzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be direct condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the Sun more slowly than the gas itself. Thus the gas in the vicinity of the snowline always comes from farther out, where it should have already condensed, and therefore it should be dry. The appearance of ice in a range of heliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial drift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a planet with a mass larger than 20 Earth mass is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because such a planet gives the disk a super-Keplerian rotation just outside of its own orbit. From this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved this threshold mass when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively fossilized the snowline at that location. In fact, even if it cooled later, the disk inside of Jupiter's orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from the outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that planetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in their inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the planetesimal disk at 0.7 AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to explain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its orbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of the phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus, when the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7. AU without being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing planetesimals.},

In this Review, we discuss breakthroughs in geochemistry and theoretical modelling that have advanced understanding of Earth accretion. Theory holds that solar nebula dust particles stuck together to form pebbles, concentrations of which gravitationally collapsed into ∼100-km-sized planetesimals, which in turn accreted to yield planets. Isotopic variations in meteorites indicate that pebbles formed within the first 100 kyr of the Solar System, planetesimals melted and differentiated within a few 100 kyr, and Mars accreted quickly within 5 Myr. Earth’s growth was more protracted, with >98% of its mass being accreted by the time of the Moon-forming Giant Impact at ∼70–120 Myr. Earth is more enriched in s-process nuclides than chondritic meteorites, with a chemical composition affected by condensation, melting and loss. Early volatiles acquired from the nebula largely escaped, with the remnant volatiles being diluted by main-stage Earth accretion, accompanied by loss of nitrogen to the core and/or space. Areas for further research should include assessing mixing during large collisions and investigating the origin of very early mantle isotopic heterogeneities, which might indicate mass transfer from core to mantle over time.},

The water ice absorption is seen toward d121-1925 and d216-0939, while the spectra of d182-316, d183-405, and d218-354 show no water ice feature around 3.1 μm within the detection limits. By comparing the water ice features toward nearby stars, we find that the water ice absorption toward d121-1925 and d216-0939 most likely originates from the foreground material and the surrounding disk, respectively. The angle of the disk inclination is found to be mainly responsible for the difference of the optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest that there is a critical inclination angle between 65° and 75° for the circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average density at the disk surface of d216-0939 was found to be 6.38 × 10-18gcm-3. The water ice absorption band in the d216-0939 disk is remarkable in that the maximum optical depth of the water ice band is at a longer wavelength than detected before. It indicates that the primary carrier of the feature is purely crystallized water ice at the surface of the d216-0939 disk with characteristic size of 0.8 μm, which suggests grain growth.

   abstract = {Moderate-resolution infrared spectra (A/AA ~ 160) from 2.4 to 3.8 /mi have been obtained for a selection of infrared protostars and one object located behind the Taurus dark cloud. The strong absorption at 3.08 /an has already been identified with H 2 0 ice by previous observations. However, we find that a comparison of the shape of this feature with a simple H 2 0 ice model provides constraints on the temperature of the ice-coated grains. For example, the spectra of GL 961, GL 989, Mon R2/IRS 2, and Elias 16 are characteristic of absorption by H 2 0 ice at temperatures lower than ~30 K, while those of BN, Mon R2/IRS 3, and GL 2591 suggest H 2 0 ice temperatures greater than 70 K. In addition, the model shows that absorption which cannot be explained by H 2 0 ice exists on both sides of the 3.08 /un feature. This additional absorption consists of at least three distinct features with maxima near 2.85 /mi, 3.3 /mi, and 3.45 /mi. A common explanation for absorption near 3.4 /mi is a mixture of H 2 0 and NH 3 ices, but higher resolution observations (2/A2 ~ 640) did not detect the N-H stretching vibration of NH 3 near 2.963 /mi in either BN or GL 989. Other explanations , such as hydrated silicates or scattering effects can also be ruled out for the 3.3 and 3.45 /mi features, although they could contribute to the absorption near 2.85 /mi. The most plausible explanation for the 3.3 and 3.45 /¿m features appears to be some form of hydrocarbons, although we cannot identify the features we observe with any other hydrocarbon feature observed astronomically. However, with this explanation, the 3.3 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in aromatic CH subgroups while the 3.45 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in CH 3 and CH 2 subgroups. Finally, O-H stretching vibrations seem to provide the most plausible explanation for the 2.85 /mi feature. This could be the result of dilution of the H 2 0 ice by other molecules, where the bonds formed between the H 2 0 and the diluting molecules have shifted the position of the O-H stretching vibration to wavelengths shorter than 3.08 /mi (i.e., the O-H stretch in pure H 2 0 ice).},

Such icy material will evolve to become volatile components of planetary systems, such as comets in our solar system. Aims. To investigate the composition and evolution of circumstellar ice around low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), we observed ice absorption bands in the near infrared (NIR) towards eight YSOs ranging from class 0 to class II, among which seven are associated with edge-on disks. Methods. We performed slit-less spectroscopic observations using the grism mode of the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on board AKARI, which enables us to obtain full NIR spectra from 2.5 μm to 5 μm, including the CO 2 band and the blue wing of the H 2O band, which are inaccessible from the ground. We developed procedures to carefully process the spectra of targets with nebulosity. The spectra were fitted with polynomial baselines to derive the absorption spectra. The molecular absorption bands were then fitted with the laboratory database of ice absorption bands, considering the instrumental line profile and the spectral resolution of the grism dispersion element. Results. Towards the class 0-I sources (L1527, IRC-L1041-2, and IRAS 04302), absorption bands of H 2O, CO 2, CO, and XCN are clearly detected. Column density ratios of CO 2 ice and CO ice relative to H 2O ice are 21-28% and 13-46%, respectively. If XCN is OCN -, its column density is as high as 2-6% relative to H 2O ice. The HDO ice feature at 4.1 μm is tentatively detected towards the class 0-I sources and HV Tau. Non-detections of the CH-stretching mode features around 3.5 μm provide upper limits to the CH 3OH abundance of 26% (L1527) and 42% (IRAS 04302) relative to H 2O. We tentatively detect OCS ice absorption towards IRC-L1041-2. Towards class 0-I sources, the detected features should mostly originate in the cold envelope, while CO gas and OCN - could originate in the region close to the protostar, where there are warm temperatures and UV radiation. We detect H 2O ice band towards ASR41 and 2MASSJ 1628137-243139, which are edge-on class II disks.

In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH 3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN, and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in an H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freezeout levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation, and the formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances is consistent with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

Although disk emission may come from fluffy dust aggregates, the emission has been modeled with compact grains. Aims. We aim to reveal the mass opacity of fluffy aggregates from infrared to millimeter wavelengths with the filling factor ranging from 1 down to $10^\{-4\}$. Methods. We use Mie calculations with an effective medium theory. The monomers are assumed to be 0.1 $\{\rm \mu m\}$ sized grains, which is much shorter than the wavelengths that we focus on. Results. We find that the absorption mass opacity of fluffy aggregates are characterized by the product $a\times f$, where $a$ is the dust radius and $f$ is the filling factor, except for the interference structure. The scattering mass opacity is also characterized by $af$ at short wavelengths while it is higher in more fluffy aggregates at long wavelengths. We also derive the analytic formula of the mass opacity and find that it reproduces the Mie calculations. We also calculate the expected difference of the emission between compact and fluffy aggregates in protoplanetary disks with a simple dust growth and drift model. We find that compact grains and fluffy aggregates can be distinguished by the radial distribution of the opacity index $\beta$. The previous observation of the radial distribution of $\beta$ is consistent with the fluffy case, but more observations are required to distinguish between fluffy or compact. In addition, we find that the scattered light would be another way to distinguish between compact grains and fluffy aggregates.},

Nevertheless, the D/H composition may have been modified to various extents in the nucleus when a comet approaches the Sun and experiences deep physical and chemical modifications in its subsurface. We question here the evolution of the D/H ratio of organic species by proton exchanges with water ice. We experimentally studied the kinetics of D/H exchanges on the ice mixtures H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>OD, H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>ND<inf>2</inf> and D<inf>2</inf>O:HCN. Our results show that fast exchanges occur on the -OH and -NH<inf>2</inf> chemical groups, which are processed through hydrogen bonds exchanges with water and by the molecular mobility triggered by structural changes, such as glass transition or crystallization. D/H exchanges kinetic is best described by a second-order kinetic law with activation energies of 4300±900K and 3300±100K for H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>OD and H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>ND<inf>2</inf> ice mixtures, respectively. The corresponding pre-exponential factors ln(A(s<sup>-1</sup>)) are 25±7 and 20±1, respectively. No exchange was observed in the case of HCN trapped in D<inf>2</inf>O ice. These results strongly suggest that upon thermal heating (1) -OH and -NH<inf>2</inf> chemical groups of any organic molecules loose their primordial D/H composition and equilibrate with water ice, (2) HCN does not experience proton transfer and keeps a primordial D/H composition and (3) C-H chemical groups are not isotopically modified.},

The crystallization kinetics was studied at 150 K by following the evolution of the band shape of the OD stretching vibration in HDO doped ASW and HGW samples generated at 14 K, 40 K and 90 K. Comparable rate constants of ∼7 × 10 -4 s -1 were obtained in all cases. However a significant difference was found between the n Avrami parameter of the samples generated at 14 K (n ∼ 1) and that of the rest (n > 2). This result hints at the possible existence of a structurally different form of amorphous ice for very low generation temperatures, already suggested in previous literature works. © 2012 the Owner Societies.},

   abstract = {A snow-line is the region of a protoplanetary disk at which a major volatile, such as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature. Snow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth of ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at temperatures of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks surrounding the pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296 (refs 3, 10), at distances of about 30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a protoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto been seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for solar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency of dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants and the cores of gas giants. Here we report images at 0.03-arcsec resolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of 1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a temporary increase in the accretion rate. We find an intensity break corresponding to an abrupt change in the optical depth at about 42 au, where the elevated disk temperature approaches the condensation point of water, from which we conclude that the outburst has moved the water snow-line. The spectral behaviour across the snow-line confirms recent model predictions: dust fragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth at higher temperatures results in soaring grain number densities and optical depths. As most planetary systems are expected to experience outbursts caused by accretion during their formation, our results imply that highly dynamical water snow-lines must be considered when developing models of disk evolution and planet formation.},

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation, and settling.},

Important nebula properties and processes that affect the evolution of small solid particles include the nebula temperature and pressure, the generally inward radial drift of particles under gas drag, and nebula gas turbulence. We review these nebula properties and describe how they affect particle evolution, emphasizing the primary accretion stage whereby the first primitive meteorite parent bodies are accumulated. We then turn to chondrite properties and discuss how they constrain the models. We treat physical properties (chondrule and re-fractory inclusion size distributions, fine-grained and coarse-grained accretionary rims, coarse-grained igneous rims), chemical and mineralogical properties (Wark-Lovering rims, redox state, and elemental fractionations), and isotopic compositions (primarily oxygen). We note how currently inferred accretion and melting ages of asteroidal bodies seem to imply that primary accretion of existing 100-km-sized objects was delayed by 1 Myr or more relative to Ca,Al-rich inclusions, and sketch scenarios for primary accretion in a temporally evolving protoplanetary nebula which allows for this hiatus. We advance a new perspective on explaining non-equilibrium mineralogy in terms of evolutionary timescales for small particles across nebula radial thermal gradients, which should be testable using meteoritical data, and present a specific application to Wark-Lovering rims.

   abstract = {Rapid orbital drift of macroscopic dust particles is one of the major obstacles to planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. We re-examine this problem by considering the porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a porosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions, which allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of impact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and instead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation has been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of the high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can evolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than 0.1 g cm-3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show that the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth. This acceleration is a natural consequence of the particles' aerodynamical properties at low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates are found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10AU (assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model). This suggests that, if collisional fragmentation is truly insignificant, formation of icy planetesimals is possible via direct collisional growth of submicron-sized icy particles. © 2012.

   abstract = {Models and observations suggest that ice-particle aggregation at and beyond the snowline dominates the earliest stages of planet-formation, which therefore is subject to many laboratory studies. However, the pressure-temperature gradients in proto-planetary disks mean that the ices are constantly processed, undergoing phase changes between different solid phases and the gas phase. Open questions remain as to whether the properties of the icy particles themselves dictate collision outcomes and therefore how effectively collision experiments reproduce conditions in pro- toplanetary environments. Previous experiments often yielded apparently contradictory results on collision outcomes, only agreeing in a temperature dependence setting in above $\approx$ 210 K. By exploiting the unique capabilities of the NIMROD neutron scattering instrument, we characterized the bulk and surface structure of icy particles used in collision experiments, and studied how these structures alter as a function of temperature at a constant pressure of around 30 mbar. Our icy grains, formed under liquid nitrogen, undergo changes in the crystalline ice-phase, sublimation, sintering and surface pre-melting as they are heated from 103 to 247 K. An increase in the thickness of the diffuse surface layer from $\approx$ 10 to $\approx$ 30 \{\AA\} ($\approx$ 2.5 to 12 bilayers) proves increased molecular mobility at temperatures above $\approx$ 210 K. As none of the other changes tie-in with the temperature trends in collisional outcomes, we conclude that the surface pre-melting phenomenon plays a key role in collision experiments at these temperatures. Consequently, the pressure-temperature environment, may have a larger influence on collision outcomes than previously thought.},

   abstract = {Context. The formation of planetesimals is often accredited to the collisional sticking of dust grains. The exact process is unknown, as collisions between larger aggregates tend to lead to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking. Recent laboratory experiments have however made great progress in the understanding and mapping of the complex physics involved in dust collisions. Aims. We study the possibility of planetesimal formation using the results of the latest laboratory experiments, particularly by including the fragmentation with mass transfer effect, which might lead to growth even at high impact velocities. Methods. We present a new experimentally and physically motivated dust collision model capable of predicting the outcome of a collision between two particles of arbitrary mass and velocity. The new model includes a natural description of cratering and mass transfer, and provides a smooth transition from equal-to different-sized collisions. It is used together with a continuum dust-size evolution code, which is both fast in terms of execution time and able to resolve the dust at all sizes, allowing for all types of interactions to be studied without biases. Results. For the general dust population, we find that bouncing collisions prevent any growth above millimeter-sizes. However, if a small number of cm-sized particles are introduced, for example by either vertical mixing or radial drift, they can act as a catalyst and start to sweep up the smaller particles. At a distance of 3 AU, 100-m-sized bodies are formed on a timescale of 1 Myr. Conclusions. Direct growth of planetesimals might be a possibility thanks to a combination of the bouncing barrier and the fragmentation with mass transfer effect. The bouncing barrier is here even beneficial, as it prevents the growth of too many large particles that would otherwise only fragment among each other, and creates a reservoir of small particles that can be swept up by larger bodies. However, for this process to work, a few seeds of cm-size or larger have to be introduced. © 2012 ESO.},

It was stated that the minimal temperature of film boiling depended on the body's surface temperature, which was influenced by the body's thermal diffusivity (heat conductivity, heat capacity, density), water temperature and heat transfer rate between the body's surface and the liquid. Bodies with higher density and higher heat capacity (made from copper and steal) accumulated more amount of heat, therefore during the cooling process the film boiling on the surface of such bodies was observed longer. From the other side, higher conductivity of the bodies' made from the copper and aluminum influenced on the more intensive cooling process, consequently the film boiling for those bodies lasted shorter. Low conductivity of the body's material sometimes (in a case of low temperature of water and high heat transfer rate) did not allow transferring sufficient amount of the heat from the internal layers to the surface of the body (steel body). Therefore the film boiling was running longer on the surface of the body which had better conductivity despite less amount of the heat accumulated in it (aluminum body). Body, made from the copper, accumulated bigger amount of the heat than the aluminum body, but cooled down faster due to the higher conductivity and higher thermal diffusivity of the copper. The fast cooling process (copper body) allowed reaching quite low Leidenfrost temperature (350°C) due to the biggest amount of the heat accumulated in it. Furthermore, big amount of the heat accumulated and high conductivity of the copper body determined that the film boiling existed on the body's surface at the lowest water temperature (70 °C). Steel body has low conductivity, therefore steam layer (film boiling) during cooling existed only for the quite high temperature of the body's surface (440 °C and higher). Aluminum body, cooling down in the water at the temperature 99 °C, reached the lowest temperature (320 °C) of the film boiling.},

High density and very high density amorphous ices retain this tetrahedral organization at short range, but show significant differences beyond about 3.1 Å from a typical water oxygen. The first diffraction peak in all structures is seen to be solely a function of the intermolecular organization. The short range connectivity in the two higher density forms is more homogeneous, while the hydrogen site disorder in these forms is greater. The low Q behavior of the structure factors indicates no significant density or concentration fluctuations over the length scale probed.

We investigate the properties of the prestellar core population embedded in the high-mass clump AGAL014.492-00.139, and we study the kinematics at the clump and clump-to-core scales. We have analyzed an extensive data set acquired with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array interferometer. Applying a dendrogram analysis to the Band 7 o‐H 2 D + data, we identified 22 cores. We fitted their average spectra in local thermodinamic equilibrium conditions, and we analyzed their continuum emission at 0.8 mm. The cores have transonic to mildly supersonic turbulence levels and appear to be mostly low-mass, with        M   core   < 30     M   ⊙      . Furthermore, we have analyzed Band 3 observations of the N 2 H + (1–0) transition, which traces the large-scale gas kinematics. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify four main velocity coherent structures, all of which are associated with prestellar and protostellar cores. One of them presents a filament-like structure, and our observations could be consistent with mass accretion toward one of the protostars. In this case, we estimate a mass accretion rate of          M   ̇     acc   ≈ 2 ×   10   − 4       M   ⊙      yr   − 1      . Our results support a clump-fed accretion scenario in the target source.

A comprehensive study of the curious ‗hole' is presented here. It covers major parts of the epochal astronomical work of William, Caroline and John Herschel. This includes a general study of ‗vacant places', found by William Herschel and others, and the speculations about their nature, eventually leading to the finding that dark nebulae are due to absorbing interstellar matter. Some of the ‗vacant places' could be identified in catalogues of dark nebulae and this leads to a ‗Herschel Catalogue of Dark Nebulae'-the first historic catalogue of its kind.},

A combination of observations, models and experiments indicates that carbonaceous dust is mostly made of a mixture of grains composed almost exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. They have different proportions of aliphatic and aromatic structures, and a variable H/C ratio. Their sizes can vary typically between the nm and the hundreds of nm. Carbonaceous grains are largely formed in the envelopes of carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and evolve in the interstellar medium, where they can be transformed or destroyed by the effects of hydrogen atoms, UV radiation, cosmic rays or shock waves from supernovae. Surviving grains eventually enter dense clouds and participate in the cloud collapse leading to star formation, closing thus their lifecycle. Within this general picture, there are doubts and issues that cannot be solved just by observation and modeling and require laboratory work. In this article we provide an overview of the development and present state of the field indicating open problems and debated questions. We stress recent experimental progress in the understanding of dust formation, both in circumstellar envelopes and the cold interstellar medium, and also in the energetic processing of dust analogs, that points to a possible top down chemistry in the diffuse medium, and especially in photon irradiated regions.},

The most widely used instruments for IDP studies are presently the analytical electron microscope, synchrotron facilities, and the ion microprobe. These laboratory analytical techniques are providing fundamental insights about IDP origins, mechanisms of formation, and grain processing phenomena that were important in the early solar system and presolar environments. At the same time, laboratory data from IDPs are being compared with astronomical data from dust in comets, circumstellar disks, and the interstellar medium. The direct comparison of grains in the laboratory with grains in astronomical environments is known as 'astromineralogy.'. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Dust particles in the solar system are produced from the small bodies: asteroids, comets, meteoroids and Kuiper belt objects. A further source of dust is provided by the warm interstellar medium that the Sun is currently embedded in and that streams into the solar system. We review the physical properties of solar system dust and trace back its interrelation with the small solar system bodies. Comets contain relatively pristine material that they transport to the inner solar system. The alteration of dust in the vicinity of comets is complex and connected to the gas evolution, but a significant part of the organic dust material survives these alterations. The optical properties of cometary dust are best described with a mixture of silicate and carbon bearing materials. As far as the darkness of the cometary material is concerned, according to recent models, this is not a result of the porosity, but rather of the darkness of the carbon bearing component. This does not contradict the observation of silicate features in the thermal emission brightness of cometary dust, since porous mixtures of silicate and carbon bearing dust can produce the observed polarization and albedo characteristics, as well as the silicate features. The carbon-bearing component is most likely an organic refactory component. The relative contributions of different sources change within the solar system dust cloud and depend as well on the measurement technique considered. In particular, the dust from asteroids, which provides a large component of the dust near Earth orbit, is also preferably seen with most of the detection methods. The majority of dust inward from 1 AU is produced from cometary dust and meteoroids. Dust material evaporation induced by collisions inward from 1 AU produces a minor heavy ion component in the solar wind plasma known as inner source pick-up ions. © 2006 International Astronomical Union.},

   abstract = {[Abridged] This review paper discussed which chemical effects may be at play in a planet-forming disk midplane, which effects are relevant under different conditions, and which tools are available for modelling chemical kinetics in a disk midplane. The review goes on to discuss some important efforts in the planet formation modelling community to treat chemical evolution, and, vice versa, efforts in the chemical modelling community to implement more physical effects related to planet formation into the chemical modelling. The aim of this review is both to outline some concepts related to planet formation chemistry, but also to encourage, not just collaboration between the planet formation modelling community and the astrochemical community, but also assistance and guidance from one community to the other. Guidance, regarding which effects, out of many, might be more relevant than others under certain planet formation conditions, and regarding why certain included effects lead to certain important modelling outcomes. As the research fields of exoplanet atmospheres and protoplanetary disks near new frontiers in observational insights with upcoming facilities, developing appropriate modelling frameworks (including physical and chemical effects) is paramount to ultimately enable the linking of a chemically characterised exoplanet atmospheres to its formation history in its natal protoplanetary disk.},

However, the precise shape and extent of this shell4,5, the impetus and timescale for its formation6,7, and its relationship to nearby star formation8 have remained uncertain, largely due to low-resolution models of the local interstellar medium. Here we report an analysis of the three-dimensional positions, shapes and motions of dense gas and young stars within 200 pc of the Sun, using new spatial9–11 and dynamical constraints12. We find that nearly all of the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly perpendicular to the bubble’s surface. Tracebacks of these young stars’ motions support a picture in which the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble’s centre beginning approximately 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of supernova-driven star formation.},

Two new surveys with iSHELL and the VISIR are combined with previous spectra from the CRIRES to cover parts of multiple rovibrational and rotational bands observable within telluric transmission bands, for a total of ≈160 spectra and 85 disks (30 of which are JWST targets in Cycle 1). The general expectation of a range of regions and excitation conditions traced by infrared water spectra is for the first time supported by the combined kinematics and excitation as spectrally resolved at multiple wavelengths. The main findings from this analysis are: (1) water lines are progressively narrower from the rovibrational bands at 2–9 <italic>μ</italic> m to the rotational lines at 12 <italic>μ</italic> m, and partly match broad and narrow emission components, respectively, as extracted from rovibrational CO spectra; (2) rotation diagrams of resolved water lines from upper-level energies of 4000–9500 K show vertical spread and curvatures indicative of optically thick emission (≈10 <sup>18</sup> cm <sup>−2</sup> ) from a range of excitation temperatures (≈800–1100 K); and (3) the new 5 <italic>μ</italic> m spectra demonstrate that slab model fits to the rotational lines at &gt;10 <italic>μ</italic> m strongly overpredict the rovibrational emission bands at &lt;9 <italic>μ</italic> m, implying vibrational excitation not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

   abstract = {<p> Conditions in the outer protoplanetary disk during solar system formation were thought to be favorable for the formation of amorphous water ice (AWI), a glassy phase of water ice. However, subsequent collisional processing could have shock-crystallized any AWI present. Here we use the iSALE shock physics hydrocode to simulate impacts between large icy bodies at impact velocities relevant to these collisional environments, and then we feed these results into a custom-built AWI crystallization script, to compute how much AWI crystallizes/survives these impact events. We find that impact speeds between icy bodies after planet migration (i.e., between trans-Neptunian objects) are too slow to crystallize any meaningful fraction of AWI. During planet migration, however, the amount of AWI that crystallizes is highly stochastic: relatively little AWI crystallizes at lower impact velocities (less than ∼2 km s <sup>−1</sup> ), yet most AWI present in the bodies (if equally sized) or impactor and impact site (if different sizes) crystallizes at higher impact velocities (greater than ∼4 km s <sup>−1</sup> ). Given that suspected impact speeds during planet migration were ∼2–4 km s <sup>−1</sup> , this suggests that primordial AWI’s ability to survive planet migration is highly stochastic. However, if proto-Edgeworth–Kuiper Belt (proto-EKB) objects and their fragments experienced multiple impact events, nearly all primordial AWI could have crystallized; such a highly collisional proto-EKB during planet migration is consistent with the lack of any unambiguous direct detection of AWI on any icy body. Ultimately, primordial AWI’s survival to the present day depends sensitively on the proto-EKB’s size–frequency distribution, which is currently poorly understood. </p>},

Our sample of disks includes Elias 2-27, WaOph 6 and the sources targeted by the MAPS ALMA Large Program. The set of molecules studied include CO isotopologues in various transitions, HCN, CN, H2CO, HCO+, C2H and c-C3H2. The vertical emitting region is determined directly from the channel maps, implementing accurate masking of the channel emission to recover the vertical location of the emission surface even at large radial distances from the star and for low-SNR lines. The vertical location of the emitting layer is obtained for 4-10 lines in each disk. IM Lup, HD163296 and MWC 480 12CO and 13CO show vertical modulations, which are coincident with dust gaps and kinematical perturbations. We also present estimates of the gas pressure scale height in the disks from the MAPS sample. Compared to physical-chemical models we find good agreement with the vertical location of CO isotopologues. In HD 163296 CN and HCN trace a similar intermediate layer, for the other disks, the UV flux tracers and the vertical profiles of HCN and C2H are lower than predicted in theoretical models. HCN and H2CO show a highly structured vertical profile, possibly indicative of different formation pathways. It is possible to trace the vertical locations of multiple molecular species that trace a wide variety of physical and chemical disk properties. The distribution of CO isotopologues are found at a wide range of vertical heights $z/r = $ 0.5-0.05. Other molecular lines are mostly found at $z/r \leq $0.15. The vertical layering of molecules is in agreement with theory in some systems, but not in all, therefore dedicated chemical-physical models are needed to further study and understand the emission surfaces.},

   abstract = {H2O and OH are readily detected in hydrated minerals in CM chondrites via reflectance spectroscopy due to their characteristic vibration absorptions at infrared wavelengths. Previous spectroscopic work on bulk powdered CM chondrites has shown that spectral parameters, like the wavelength position of the “3 μm absorption feature,” vary systematically with the extent to which the samples have been aqueously altered. However, it is yet unclear how these spectral features may vary across an intact meteorite chip when measured at spatial scales smaller than that of the individual components of the meteorite. Here, we explore the spatial variability of this spectral feature and others on intact CM2 chips which, unlike powders, retain their petrologic and textural characteristics. We also model the modal mineralogy of the bulk meteorite powders and correlate this with key spectral features, demonstrating that microscope Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic mapping provides a powerful, rapid, and non-destructive technique for assessing compositional diversity and variations in water–rock interactions in chondritic planetary materials. In all CM2 chondrites studied here, we find that variations in the position, shape, and strength of the 3 μm absorption feature reveal a single chondrite can exhibit as much spectral variation as the entire suite of CM2 chondrites. The observed variations in the position and shape of the 3 μm feature within individual CM2 chondrite chips suggest a range of alteration products (e.g., Mg-rich to Fe-rich phyllosilicates) are present and record sub-mm scale variations in the amount and/or chemistry of the altering fluids. The samples having experienced the most progressive aqueous alteration show the least amount of variability in features like the 3 μm absorption band minimum position, whereas the least altered samples exhibit the most variability. We also find that the bulk spectral signatures in the least altered samples appear to be biased toward the spectral signatures of clasts versus matrix. By extension, asteroid reflectance spectra exhibiting 3 μm absorption features consistent with those measured here may be interpreted in a similar framework in which the spectrum of what may appear to be the least altered asteroids represents an average that belies the true diversity of mineralogy and chemistry of the body.},

   abstract = {<p> By performing <italic>N</italic> -body simulations, we investigated the fundamental processes of collisions between dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized icy dust monomers. We examined the mass distribution of fragments in the collisional outcomes in a wide range of the mass ratio and the collision velocity between colliding dust aggregates. We derived analytic expressions of the mass distribution of large remnants and small fragments by numerical fitting to the simulation results. Our analytic formulae for masses of the large remnants can reproduce the contribution of mass transfer from a large target to a small projectile, which occurs for a mass ratio of ≳3 and is shown in a previous study. We found that the power-law index of the cumulative mass distribution of the small fragments is independent of the mass ratio and only weakly dependent on the collision velocity. On the other hand, the mass fraction of fragments of individual dust monomers decreases with an increasing total mass of colliding aggregates for a fixed mass ratio. This tendency implies that multiple hierarchical disruptive collisions (i.e., collisions between fragments, and collisions between fragments of fragments) are required for producing a large number of individual dust monomers via collisional fragmentation. Our fragment model suggests that the total geometric cross section integrated over the fragments is estimated to be about the same order as the geometric cross section of the target. </p>},

   abstract = {The latest observation of HL Tau by ALMA revealed spectacular concentric dust rings in its circumstellar disk. We attempt to explain the multiple ring structure as a consequence of aggregate sintering. Sintering is known to reduce the sticking efficiency of dust aggregates and occurs at temperatures slightly below the sublimation point of their constituent material. We here present a dust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust evolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift in a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple species of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile up at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At wavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically thick rings with a spectral slope of $\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering zones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\approx$ 2.3--2.5. The observational features of the sintering and non-sintering zones are consistent with those of the major bright and dark rings found in the HL Tau disk, respectively. Radial pileup and vertical settling occur simultaneously if disk turbulence is weak and if monomers constituting the aggregates are $\sim 1~\{\rm \mu m\}$ in radius. For the radial gas temperature profile of $T = 310(r/1~\{\rm AU\})^\{-0.57\}~\{\rm K\}$, our model perfectly reproduces the brightness temperatures of the optically thick bright rings, and reproduces their orbital distances to an accuracy of $\lesssim$ 30%.},

   abstract = {Several properties of the Solar System, including the wide radial spacing of the giant planets, can be explained if planets radially migrated by exchanging orbital energy and momentum with outer disk planetesimals. Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, in particular, has a strong advocate in the dynamical structure of the Kuiper belt. A dynamical instability is thought to have occurred during the early stages with Jupiter having close encounters with a Neptune-class planet. As a result of the encounters, Jupiter acquired its current orbital eccentricity and jumped inward by a fraction of an astronomical unit, as required for the survival of the terrestrial planets and from asteroid belt constraints. Planetary encounters also contributed to capture of Jupiter Trojans and irregular satellites of the giant planets. Here we discuss the dynamical evolution of the early Solar System with an eye to determining how models of planetary migration/instability can be constrained from its present architecture. Specifically, we review arguments suggesting that the Solar System may have originally contained a third ice giant on a resonant orbit between Saturn and Uranus. This hypothesized planet was presumably ejected into interstellar space during the instability. The Kuiper belt kernel and other dynamical structures in the trans-Neptunian region may provide evidence for the ejected planet. We favor the early version of the instability where Neptune migrated into the outer planetesimal disk within a few tens of millions of years after the dispersal of the protosolar nebula. If so, the planetary migration/instability was not the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment. Mercury's orbit may have been excited during the instability.},

This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner 1 AU of protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging.

This review highlights recent advances in multi-wavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subs highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady-state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

Extinct radioactivities suggest that the Sun's birth environment was decoupled from average galactic nucleosynthesis for some tens to hundreds of Myr but was enriched in short-lived isotopes from massive stellar winds or explosions shortly before or during formation of the Solar System. Radiometric dating of meteorite components tells us about the timing and duration over which solar nebula solids were assembled into the building blocks of the planets. Components of the most primitive meteoritical materials provide further detailed constraints on the formation, processing, and transport of material and associated timescales in the Sun's protoplanetary disk as well as in other forming planetary systems.},

   abstract = {Cold sintering is an unusually low-temperature process that uses a transient transport phase, which is most often liquid, and an applied uniaxial force to assist in densification of a powder compact. By using this approach, many ceramic powders can be transformed to high-density monoliths at temperatures far below the melting point. In this article, we present a summary of cold sintering accomplishments and the current working models that describe the operative mechanisms in the context of other strategies for low-temperature ceramic densification. Current observations in several systems suggest a multiple-stage densification process that bears similarity to models that describe liquid phase sintering. We find that grain growth trends are consistent with classical behavior, but with activation energy values that are lower than observed for thermally driven processes. Densification behavior in these low-temperature systems is rich, and there is much to be investigated regarding mass transport within and across the liquid-solid interfaces that populate these ceramics during densification. Irrespective of mechanisms, these low temperatures create a new opportunity spectrum to design grain boundaries and create new types of nanocomposites among material combinations that previously had incompatible processing windows. Future directions are discussed in terms of both the fundamental science and engineering of cold sintering. 275},

   abstract = {Major advances in deciphering the record of nebula processes in chondrites can be attributed to analytical improvements that allow coordinated isotopic and mineralogical studies of components in chondrites and to a wealth of new meteorites from hot and cold deserts. These studies have identified a few rare pristine chondrites that largely escaped heating and alteration in asteroids, which have matrices composed of submicrometer-sized grains of enstatite and forsterite and amorphous silicates, as found in comets. Isotopic analyses of components in pristine chondrites using short-lived nuclide chronometers, Pb-Pb dating, and oxygen isotopes aided by laboratory and theoretical studies of chondrites and differentiated meteorites have provided key constraints on the processes that shaped the early solar system. These processes were once thought to have followed one another sequentially over a period of several million years: chondrule formation; planetesimal accretion; alteration, metamorphism, and melting in planetesimals; and finally, high-velocity collisions between asteroids. Radiometric dating shows, however, that these processes overlapped so that chondrules were still forming in the nebula several million years after early-formed planetesimals had melted and collided. Chondrites are extraordinary mixtures of presolar and solar nebula materials and asteroidal debris. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The supersolar abundances of volatiles observed in giant planets suggest that a compositional gradient was present at the time of their formation in the protosolar nebula. To explain this gradient, several studies have investigated the radial transport of trace species and the effect of icelines on the abundance profiles of solids and vapors formed in the disk. However, these models only consider the presence of solids in the forms of pure condensates or amorphous ice during the evolution of the protosolar nebula. They usually neglect the possible crystallization and destabilization of clathrates, along with the resulting interplay between the abundance of water and those of these crystalline forms. This study is aimed at pushing this kind of investigation further by considering all possible solid phases together in the protosolar nebula: pure condensates, amorphous ice, and clathrates. To this end, we used a one-dimensional (1D) protoplanetary disk model coupled with modules describing the evolution of trace species in the vapor phase, as well as the dynamics of dust and pebbles. Eleven key species are considered here, including H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S, N$_2$, NH$_3$, Ar, Kr, Xe, and PH$_3$. Two sets of initial conditions are explored for the protosolar nebula. In a first scenario, the disk is initially filled with icy grains in the forms of pure condensates. In this case, we show that clathrates can crystallize and form enrichment peaks up to about ten times the initial abundances at their crystallization lines. In a second scenario, the volatiles were delivered to the protosolar nebula in the forms of amorphous grains. In this case, the presence of clathrates is not possible because there is no available crystalline water ice in their formation region. Enrichment peaks of pure condensates also form beyond the snowline up to about seven times the initial abundances.},

   abstract = {In protoplanetary disks, solid objects (so-called planetesimals) are formed from dust. Micrometre-sized dust grains grow into millimetre-sized aggregates. Once those aggregates have diameters exceeding a few centimetres, they become subject to concentration mechanisms such as the streaming instability, permitting the formation of self-gravitating clusters, which might eventually collapse into kilometre-sized planetesimals. However, for the streaming instability to set in, clumps spanning sizes from centimetres to decimetres are required in the centre of a protoplanetary disk. In the size range between millimetres and centimetres, aggregates bounce off each other rather than sticking together, and growth is stalled. Here we show in microgravity experiments that collisions between millimetre-sized grains lead to sufficient electrical charging for aggregation to bridge this gap between the bouncing barrier and the onset of the streaming instability. We computationally simulate aggregation and find that models agree with the experimental data only if electrical charging is present. We therefore propose that collisional charging may promote early growth in the size gap that current models of planetesimal formation cannot account for.},

The measurements show that the quantum yields of electronically excited C atoms in the photodissociation of 13C16O are dramatically different from those of 12C16O, revealing strong isotope effect. This isotope effect strongly depends on specific quantum states of CO being excited, which implies that such effect must be considered in the photochemical models on a state by state basis.},

While high-excitation water lines originating in the hot inner disk have been detected in several T Tauri stars (TTSs), water vapor from the outer disk, where most water ice reservoirs are stored, was only reported in the nearby TTS TW Hya. We present spectrally resolved Herschel/HIFI observations of the young TTS DG Tau in the ortho- and para-water ground-state transitions at 557 and 1113 GHz. The lines show a narrow double-peaked profile, consistent with an origin in the outer disk, and are ∼19-26 times brighter than in TW Hya. In contrast, CO and [C II] lines are dominated by emission from the envelope/outflow, which makes H2O lines a unique tracer of the disk of DG Tau. Disk modeling with the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo indicates that the strong UV field, due to the young age and strong accretion of DG Tau, irradiates a disk upper layer at 10-90 AU from the star, heating it up to temperatures of 600 K and producing the observed bright water lines. The models suggest a disk mass of 0.015-0.1 M , consistent with the estimated minimum mass of the solar nebula before planet formation, and a water reservoir of ∼102-103 Earth oceans in vapor and ∼100 times larger in the form of ice. Hence, this detection supports the scenario of ocean delivery on terrestrial planets by the impact of icy bodies forming in the outer disk. © 2013 The American Astronomical Society.

In view of this model, we carried out laboratory experiments where we observed freely levitating ice aggregates sublimating. We find that frequent breakup is indeed very common. Scaled to a 10cm aggregate, about 2 × 104 small silicate aggregates might result. This supports the idea that sublimation of drifting ice aggregates might locally increase the density of small dust (silicate) particles which might more easily be swept up by larger dust aggregates or trigger gravitational instability.

The infall of these aggregates to the central star is due to gas drag, and their temperature increases as the infall proceeds. The icy molecules on the grain move to the neck where the grains get connected through sublimation and condensation of the molecules. This process is called sintering. As the sintering proceeds, the mechanical strength of the neck changes considerably, strongly affecting the collisional evolution of the aggregates. The timescale required for sintering is determined in this study, based on which the region where the sintering proceeds within a prescribed timescale is obtained. It is found that the region covers a substantial fraction of the protoplanetary nebula, and the location of the region depends on the temperature distribution inside the nebula. If the aggregate is stirred up and the temperature of the aggregate increases temporally, the sintering region spreads to the whole nebula. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

Water plays an important role as a reaction bed for rich chemistry and is an indispensable requirement for life as known on Earth. Methods. We present our analysis of NAOS-CONICA/VLT spectroscopy of water ice at 3 μm for the T Tauri star YLW 16 A in the ρ Ophiuchi molecular cloud. We obtained spectra for different regions of the circumstellar environment. The observed absorption profiles are deconvolved with the mass extinction profiles of amorphous and crystallized ice measured in laboratory. We take into account both absorption and scattering by ice grains. Results. Water ice in YLW16A is detected with optical depths of between τ = 1.8 and τ = 2.5. The profiles that are measured can be fitted predominantly by the extinction profiles of small grains (0.1 μm-0.3 μm) with a small contribution from large grains (<10%). However, an unambiguous trace of grain growth cannot be found. We detected crystallized water ice spectra that have their origin in different regions of the circumstellar environment of the T Tauri star YLW 16 A. The crystallinity increases in the upper layers of the circumstellar disk, while only amorphous grains exist in the bipolar envelope. As in studies of silicate grains in T Tauri objects, the higher crystallinity in the upper layers of the outer disk regions implies that water ice crystallizes and remains crystallized close to the disk atmosphere where water ice is shielded against hard irradiation.},

We detect a forest of emission lines from molecules previously identified in infrared spectra of classical T Tauri disks: H <sub>2</sub> O, OH, H <sub>2</sub> , HCN, C <sub>2</sub> H <sub>2</sub> , and CO <sub>2</sub> . The detection of organic molecules demonstrates that they are back after disappearing during the large outburst. Spectral lines from water and OH are for the first time deblended and will provide a much-improved characterization of their distribution and density in the inner disk. The spectrum also shows broad emission bands from warm, submicron-size amorphous silicate grains at 10 and 18 <italic>μ</italic> m. During the outburst, in 2008, crystalline forsterite grains were annealed in the inner disk within 1 au, but their spectral signatures in the 10 <italic>μ</italic> m silicate band later disappeared. With JWST we rediscovered these crystals via their 19.0, 20.0, and 23.5 <italic>μ</italic> m emission, the strength of which implies that the particles are at ∼3 au from the star. This suggests that crystalline grains formed in 2008 were transported outwards and now approach the water snowline, where they may be incorporated into planetesimals. Containing several key tracers of planetesimal and planet formation, EX Lup is an ideal laboratory to study the effects of variable luminosity on the planet-forming material and may provide an explanation for the observed high crystalline fraction in solar system comets. </p>},

Existing studies commonly try to constrain atmospheric abundances, or to analyze what abundance patterns a given description of planet formation predicts. However, there is also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet’s composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances to planet formation for a given planet may be challenging, but a qualitative understanding of the effects of different formation models is possible, opening up pathways for new investigations.},

   abstract = {Context. Planets and their atmospheres are built from gas and solid material in protoplanetary disks. This solid material grows from smaller micron-sized grains to larger sizes in the disks during the process of planet formation. This solid growth may influence the efficiency of chemical reactions that take place on the surfaces of the grains and in turn affect the chemical evolution that the gas and solid material in the disk undergoes, with implications for the chemical composition of the planets. Aims. Our goal is to model the compositional evolution of volatile ices on grains of different sizes, assuming both time-dependent grain growth and several constant grain sizes. We also examine the dependence on the initial chemical composition. Methods. The custom Walsh chemical kinetics code was used to model the chemical evolution. This code was upgraded to account for the time-evolving sizes of solids. Chemical evolution was modelled locally at four different radii in a protoplanetary disk midplane (with associated midplane temperatures of 120, 57, 25, and 19.5 K) for up to 10 Myr. The evolution was modelled for five different constant grain sizes, and in one model, the grain size changed with time according to a grain-growth model appropriate for the disk midplane. Results. Local grain growth, with conservation of the total grain mass, and assuming spherical grains, acts to reduced the total grain-surface area that is available for ice-phase reactions. This reduces the efficiency of these reactions compared to a chemical scenario with a conventional grain-size choice of 0.1 μm. The chemical evolution modelled with grain growth leads to increased abundances of H2O ice. For carbon in the inner disk, grain growth causes CO gas to overtake CO2 ice as the dominant carrier, and in the outer disk, CH4 ice becomes the dominant carrier. Larger grain sizes cause less change the C/O ratio in the gas phase over time than when 0.1 μm sized grains are considered. Overall, a constant grain size adopted from a grain evolution model leads to an almost identical chemical evolution as a chemical evolution with evolving grain sizes. A constant grain size choice, albeit larger than 0.1 μm, may therefore be an appropriate simplification when modelling the impact of grain growth on chemical evolution.},

This behaviour can be observed up to an upper threshold, that depends on the projectile size, beyond which there is no mass transfer. In collisions of small particles, as produced by the disruption of the centimetre projectiles, we also find mass transfer to the target. In this way the larger body can gain mass, although the efficiency of the initial mass transfer is rather low. These collision results can be applied to planetesimal formation near the snowline, where evaporation and condensation is expected to produce solid ice. In free fall collisions at velocities up to about $7\,\mathrm\{m\,s^\{-1\}\}$, we investigated the threshold to fragmentation and coefficient of restitution of centimetre ice spheres.},

   abstract = {We measured the bidirectional reflectance in the VIS-NIR spectral range of different surfaces prepared from small-grained spherical water-ice particles over a wide range of incidence and emission geometries, including opposition. We show that coherent backscattering is dominating the opposition effect on fresh sample material, but its contribution decreases when particles become more irregularly shaped and the bulk porosity increases. Strong temporal evolution of the photometric properties of icy samples, caused by particle sintering and resulting in a decrease of backscattering, is shown. The sintering of the ice particles is documented using cryo-SEM micrographs of fresh and evolved samples. To complement the photometric characterization of ices, multiple high albedo laboratory analogs were investigated to study the effects of shape, grain size distribution, wavelength and surface roughness. In addition to the main backscattering peak, the phase curves also display the effect of glory in the case of surfaces of granular surfaces formed by either spherical ice or glass particles. We show that the angular position of the glory can be used to determine accurately the average size of the particles. Reflectance data are fitted by the Hapke photometric model, the Minnaert model and three morphological models. The resulting parameters can be used to reproduce our data and compare them to the results of other laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.},

This form of ice, named ice XI, can generate enormous electric fields and can play an important role in planetary formation. We measured neutron diffraction profiles of D2O ice with impurities to investigate the formation of ice XI under atmospheric pressure. We made powder samples of ice doped with KOD, NaOD, LiOD, DCl, ND3, and Ca(OD)2. We carried out Rietveld analysis for diffraction profiles and obtained the mass fraction f (the ratio of the mass of ice XI to that of the doped ice). A significant amount of ferroelectric ice is observed in ice samples with dopants, which produce L-defect. The values of f of ice doped with 0.01–0.001-M KOD or NaOD is generally higher than those with 0.1-M KOD or NaOD. On the other hand, ice samples with D-defect, did not become ferroelectric ice.

It is not known how growth proceeds to kilometre sizes but it has been proposed that water ice beyond the snow line might impact this process. Aims. In order to better understand collisional processes in protoplanetary disks leading to planet formation, individual low velocity collisions of small ice particles were investigated. Methods. The particles were collided together under microgravity conditions on a parabolic flight campaign using a purpose built, cryogenically cooled experimental setup. The setup was capable of colliding together pairs of small ice particles (between 4.7 and 10.8 mm in diameter) at relative collision velocities of between 0.27 and 0.51 m s −1 at temperatures between 131 and 160 K. Two types of ice particle were used; ice spheres and irregularly shaped ice fragments. Results. Bouncing was observed in the majority of cases with a few cases of fragmentation. A full range of normalised impact parameters (b/R = 0.0-1.0) was realised with this apparatus. Coefficients of restitution were evenly spread between 0.08 and 0.65 with an average value of 0.36, leading to a minimum of 58% of translational energy being lost in the collision. Analysis of particle rotation showed that up to 17% of the energy of the particles before the collision was converted into rotational energy. Temperature did not impact coefficients of restitution over the range studied.},

   abstract = {Context. It has been proposed that icy dust may stick more readily than "bare" dust particles, offering a way to overcome the bouncing barrier in planet formation. Other simple chemicals such as methanol and formic acid are also known to be present in cold protostellar regions; they are also likely to pervade into protoplanetary ice. It is therefore likely that icy dust grains beyond the snowline are composed of a mixture of water and other substances. However, the effect of the chemical composition of the ice on its collisional properties has not yet been studied. Aims. Collisions of 1.5 cm ice spheres composed of pure crystalline water ice, water with 5% methanol, and water with 5% formic acid were investigated to determine the effect of the ice composition on the collisional outcomes. Methods. The collisions were conducted in a dedicated experimental instrument, operated under microgravity conditions, at relative particle impact velocities between 0.01 and 0.19 m s −1 , temperatures between 131 and 160 K and a pressure of around 10 −5 mbar. Results. A range of coefficients of restitution were found, with no correlation between this and the chemical composition, relative impact velocity, or temperature. Conclusions. We conclude that the chemical composition of the ice (at the level of 95% water ice and 5% methanol or formic acid) does not affect the collisional properties at these temperatures and pressures due to the inability of surface wetting to take place. At a level of 5% methanol or formic acid, the structure is likely to be dominated by crystalline water ice, leading to no change in collisional properties. The surface roughness of the particles is the dominant factor in explaining the range of coefficients of restitution.},

This implies that (ice) aggregates in astrophysical settings with small constituents are more robust against restructuring than previously thought.

We performed head-on collision experiments in air by means of free-falling centimeter-sized sintered snowballs with porosities from 44% to 80% at impact velocities from 0.44ms -1 to 4.12ms -1 at -10°C. In cases of porosity larger than 70%, impact sticking was the dominant collision outcome, while bouncing was dominant at lower porosity. Coefficients of restitution of snow in this velocity range were found to depend strongly on the porosity rather than the impact velocity and to decrease with the increase of the porosity. We successfully measured the compaction volume of snowballs after the impact, and it enabled us to estimate the dynamic compressive strength of snow with the assumption of the energy conservation between kinetic energy and work for deformation, which was found to be consistent with the upper limit of static compressive strength. The velocity dependence of coefficients of restitution of snow was analyzed using a Johnson's model, and a diagram for collision outcomes among equal-sized sintered snowballs was successfully drawn as a function of porosity and impact velocity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Projectile sticking occurred at the impact velocity higher than 44. m/s for 60% porosity targets and higher than 13. m/s for 70% porosity targets. The antipodal velocity of the porous ice target increased with the increase of energy density, Q, and it increased slightly with the increase of porosity, although it was exceptionally high in cases when the projectile penetrated the target. The shattering strength of porous ice targets was found to decrease from 100 to 31. J/kg with the increase of porosity from 40% to 70%. The cumulative fragment mass distribution was found to depend on the energy density and the target porosity, and the slopes of the distribution in the small fragment region were almost flat for more porous targets.

Structure, stability and evolution of Saturn's rings. Nature 1984;309:333-5] in order to measure the coefficient of restitution for ice particles are thoroughly analyzed. One particularly troublesome aspect of the aforementioned experiments is fracture of the ice particles during a collision. In the present effort, the collisional properties of the ice particles are investigated using a Finite Element approach. It is found that a major challenge in modeling collision of the ice balls is the prediction of the onset of fracture and crack propagation in them. In simulations of a block of ice collision to a structure, it is crucial that fracture is determined correctly, as it will influence the collisional properties of the ice particles. The results of the simulation, considering fracture criterion implemented into the Finite Element Model [Zamankhan P, Bordbar M-H. Complex flow dynamics in dense granular flows.

It is still unclear if planetesimals can be formed from these objects by collisional growth. Aims. Therefore, it is important to study numerically the collisional outcome from low velocity impacts of equal sized porous agglomerates which are too large to be examined in a laboratory experiment. Methods. We use the Lagrangian particle method Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to solve the equations that describe the dynamics of elastic and plastic bodies. Additionally, to account for the influence of porosity, we follow a previous developed equation of state and certain relations between the material strength and the relative density. Results. Collisional growth seems possible for rather low collision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants of collisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of the colliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the colliding objects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of the porous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth. The protoplanetesimals, however, do not stick together for the most part of the employed material strengths. Conclusions. An important issue in subsequent studies has to be the influence of rotation to collisional growth. Moreover, for realistic simulations of protoplanetesimals it is crucial to know the correct material parameters in more detail. © ESO 2007.},

Crater dimensions in ice targets increase slightly with increasing target temperatures. Crater volumes of strength-controlled ice craters are about 10 to 100 times larger than those observed for craters in crystalline rocks. Based on similarity analysis, general scaling laws for strength-controlled crater formation are derived and are applied to crater formation on the icy Galilean and Saturnian satellites. This analysis indicates that surface ages, based on impact-crater statistics on an icy crust, will appear greater than those for a silicate crust which experienced the same impact history. The greater ejecta volume for cratering in ice versus cratering in silicate targets leads to accelerated regolith production on an icy planet. ~,~},

The results are in quantitative agreement with the new evaporation–condensation theory, and further confirmation was obtained from experiments with spheres of heavy ice, and by the observed effects of replacing the air by either hydrogen or silicone oil. It is argued that the sintering of ice by either volume or surface diffusion would be slower by almost four orders of magnitude.

Planetesimals are the seeds of both terrestrial planets and the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core accretion. Left-over planetesimals in the form of asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects and comets provide a unique record of the physical conditions in the solar nebula. Debris from planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts that the planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation, is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage extends from micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies which can undergo run-away accretion. The latter ranges in size from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations. Particles face many barriers during this growth, arising mainly from inefficient sticking, fragmentation and radial drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass transfer, where small aggregates transfer up to 50% of their mass in high-speed collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy growth, where aggregate cross sections and sticking probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A wide range of particle sizes, from mm to 10 m, concentrate in the turbulent gas flow. Overdense filaments fragment gravitationally into bound particle clumps, with most mass entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 to 500 km, depending on local disc properties. We propose a hybrid model for planetesimal formation where particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals with a wide range of sizes.},

   abstract = {When comet nuclei approach the Sun, the increasing energy flux through the surface layers leads to sublimation of the underlying ices and subsequent outgassing that promotes the observed emission of gas and dust. While the release of gas can be straightforwardly understood by solving the heat-transport equation and taking into account the finite permeability of the ice-free dust layer close to the surface of the comet nucleus, the ejection of dust additionally requires that the forces binding the dust particles to the comet nucleus must be overcome by the forces caused by the sublimation process. This relates to the question of how large the tensile strength of the overlying dust layer is. Homogeneous layers of micrometer-sized dust particles reach tensile strengths of typically 103 to 104 Pa. This exceeds by far the maximum sublimation pressure of water ice in comets. It is therefore unclear how cometary dust activity is driven.To solve this paradox, we used the model by Skorov and Blum (Skorov, Y.V., Blum, J. 2012. Icarus 221, 361-11), who assumed that cometesimals formed by gravitational instability of a cloud of dust and ice aggregates and calculated for the corresponding structure of comet nuclei tensile strength of the dust-aggregate layers on the order of 1. Pa. Here we present evidence that the emitted cometary dust particles are indeed aggregates with the right properties to fit the model by Skorov and Blum. Then we experimentally measure the tensile strengths of layers of laboratory dust aggregates and confirm the values derived by the model. To explain the comet activity driven by the evaporation of water ice, we derive a minimum size for the dust aggregates of ~1. mm, in agreement with meteoroid observations and dust-agglomeration models in the solar nebula. Finally we conclude that cometesimals must have formed by gravitational instability, because all alternative formation models lead to higher tensile strengths of the surface layers. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Collisional growth of dust aggregates is an essential process in forming planetesimals in protoplanetary disks, but disruption through high-velocity collisions (disruption barrier) could prohibit the dust growth. Mass transfer through very different-sized collisions has been suggested as a way to circumvent the disruption barrier. Aims. We examine how the collisional growth efficiency of dust aggregates with different impact parameters depends on the size and the mass ratio of colliding aggregates. Methods. We used an N-body code to numerically simulate the collisions of different-sized aggregates. Results. Our results show that high values for the impact parameter are important and that the growth efficiency averaged over the impact parameter does not depend on the aggregate size, although the growth efficiency for nearly head-on collisions increases with size. We also find that the averaged growth efficiency tends to increase with increasing mass ratio of colliding aggregates. However, the critical collision velocity, above which the growth efficiency becomes negative, does not strongly depend on the mass ratio. These results indicate that icy dust can grow through high-velocity offset collisions at several tens of m s-1, the maximum collision velocity experienced in protoplanetary disks, whereas it is still difficult for silicate dust to grow in protoplanetary disks. © ESO, 2013.},

   abstract = {Context. Several barriers have been proposed in planetesimal formation theory: bouncing, fragmentation, and radial drift problems. Understanding the structure evolution of dust aggregates is a key in planetesimal formation. Dust grains become fluffy by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. However, once they are fluffy, they are not sufficiently compressed by collisional compression to form compact planetesimals. Aims. We aim to reveal the pathway of dust structure evolution from dust grains to compact planetesimals. Methods. Using the compressive strength formula, we analytically investigate how fluffy dust aggregates are compressed by static compression due to ram pressure of the disk gas and self-gravity of the aggregates in protoplanetary disks. Results. We reveal the pathway of the porosity evolution from dust grains via fluffy aggregates to form planetesimals, circumventing the barriers in planetesimal formation. The aggregates are compressed by the disk gas to a density of 10 -3 g/cm3 in coagulation, which is more compact than is the case with collisional compression. Then, they are compressed more by self-gravity to 10-1 g/cm3 when the radius is 10 km. Although the gas compression decelerates the growth, the aggregates grow rapidly enough to avoid the radial drift barrier when the orbital radius is 6 AU in a typical disk. Conclusions. We propose a fluffy dust growth scenario from grains to planetesimals. It enables icy planetesimal formation in a wide range beyond the snowline in protoplanetary disks. This result proposes a concrete initial condition of planetesimals for the later stages of the planet formation. © ESO, 2013.},

   abstract = {We show that condensation is an efficient particle growth mechanism that leads to growth beyond decimetre-sized pebbles close to an ice line in protoplanetary discs. As coagulation of dust particles is frustrated by bouncing and fragmentation, condensation could be a complementary, or even dominant, growth mode in the early stages of planet formation. Ice particles diffuse across the ice line and sublimate, and vapour diffusing inwards across the ice line recondenses onto already existing particles, causing them to grow. We develop a numerical model of the dynamical behaviour of ice particles close to the water ice line, approximately 3 AU from the host star. Particles move with the turbulent gas, modelled as a random walk. They also sediment towards the midplane and drift radially towards the central star. Condensation and sublimation are calculated using a Monte Carlo approach. Our results indicate that, with a turbulent α-value of 0.01, growth from millimetre to at least decimetre-sized pebbles is possible on a time scale of 1000 years. We find that particle growth is dominated by ice and vapour transport across the radial ice line, with negligible growth caused by transport across the atmospheric ice line. Ice particles mix outwards by turbulent diffusion, leading to net growth across the entire cold region. The resulting particles are large enough to be sensitive to concentration by streaming instabilities, pressure bumps and vortices, which can cause further growth into planetesimals. In our model, particles are considered to be homogeneous ice particles. Considering the more realistic composition of ice condensed onto rocky ice nuclei might affect the growth time scales, by release of refractory ice nuclei after sublimation. We also ignore sticking and fragmentation in particle collisions. These effects will be the subject of future investigations. © 2013 ESO.},

   abstract = {Geometric cross sections of dust aggregates determine their coupling with disk gas, which governs their motions in protoplanetary disks. Collisional outcomes also depend on geometric cross sections of initial aggregates. In a previous paper, we performed three-dimensional N-body simulations of sequential collisions of aggregates composed of a number of sub-micron-sized icy particles and examined radii of gyration (and bulk densities) of the obtained aggregates. We showed that collisional compression of aggregates is not efficient and that aggregates remain fluffy. In the present study, we examine geometric cross sections of the aggregates. Their cross sections decrease due to compression as well as to their gyration radii. It is found that a relation between the cross section and the gyration radius proposed by Okuzumi et al. is valid for the compressed aggregates. We also refine the compression model proposed in our previous paper. The refined model enables us to calculate the evolution of both gyration radii and cross sections of growing aggregates and reproduces well our numerical results of sequential aggregate collisions. The refined model can describe non-equal-mass collisions as well as equal-mass cases. Although we do not take into account oblique collisions in the present study, oblique collisions would further hinder compression of aggregates. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

However, in contrast to silicates, laboratory investigations of the collision properties of micrometer-sized ice particles (in particular, of the most abundant H2O-ice) have not been conducted yet. Thus, we used two different experimental methods to produce micrometer-sized H2O-ice particles, i.e. by spraying H2O droplets into liquid nitrogen and by spraying H2O droplets into a cold nitrogen atmosphere. The mean particle radii of the ice particles produced with these experimental methods are (1.49±0.79)μm and (1.45±0.65)μm. Ice aggregates composed of the micrometer-sized ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor: φ=0.11±0.01) or rather compact (volume filling factor: φ=0.72±0.04), depending on the method of production. Furthermore, the critical rolling friction force of FRoll,ice=(114.8±23.8)×10-10N was measured for micrometer-sized ice particles, which exceeds the critical rolling friction force of micrometer-sized SiO2 particles (FRoll,SiO2=(12.1±3.6)×10-10N). This result implies that the adhesive bonding between micrometer-sized ice particles is stronger than the bonding strength between SiO2 particles.

   abstract = {The precise location of the water ice condensation front ('snow line') in the protosolar nebula has been a debate for a long time. Its importance stems from the expected substantial jump in the abundance of solids beyond the snow line, which is conducive to planet formation, and from the higher stickiness in collisions of ice-coated dust grains, which may help the process of coagulation of dust and the formation of planetesimals. In an optically thin nebula, the location of the snow line is easily calculated to be around 3 AU. However, in its first 5 to 10 million years, the solar nebula was optically thick, implying a smaller snow line radius due to shielding from direct sunlight, but also a larger radius because of viscous heating. Several models have attempted to treat these opposing effects. However, until recently treatments beyond an approximate 1+1D radiative transfer were unfeasible. We revisit the problem with a fully self-consistent 3D treatment in an axisymmetric disk model, including a density-dependent treatment of the dust and ice sublimation. We find that the location of the snow line is very sensitive to the opacities of the dust grains and the mass accretion rate of the disk. We show that previous approximate treatments are quite efficient at determining the location of the snow line if the energy budget is locally dominated by viscous accretion. We derive an analytic estimate of the location of the snow line that compares very well with results from this and previous studies. Using solar abundances of the elements we compute the abundance of dust and ice and find that the expected jump in solid surface density at the snow line is smaller than previously assumed. We further show that in the inner few AU the refractory species are partly evaporated, leading to a significantly smaller solid state surface density in the regions where the rocky planets were formed.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the residual porosity of small icy bodies, we performed compaction experiments on ice-silica mixtures and studied the effects of silica content, temperature, and compaction time scale on residual porosity. To simulate the compositions of real icy bodies, we used ice-silica mixtures with different silica volume fractions (0-0.29). The mixtures were compacted at a constant compression speed of 0.2 or 2.0 mm/min and the temperature was set to -10°C or a lower temperature (from -55 to -67°C). For the -10°C case, the mixtures were compressed to pressures of 30 MPa, while the lower temperature measurements were compressed to 80 MPa. In both cases, the residual porosity was found to be larger for higher silica fractions. At -10°C and 30 MPa, the residual porosity varied from 0.01 to 0.14 for silica fractions of 0-0.29, whereas for the -55 to -67°C and 80 MPa case, the corresponding residual porosities were 2-10 times larger. A two-layer model was proposed to calculate the compaction curves of ice-silica mixtures from the curves of the corresponding pure materials. We estimated the residual porosity of small icy bodies using this two-layer model. From our calculations, we expect that icy bodies with diameters smaller than 700 km have residual porosity larger than 0.3 when the temperature is lower than -55°C.

   abstract = {The bulk density of dust aggregates is an important factor in collisional growth of dust in protoplanetary disks. The density of aggregates changes the coupling with the disk gas, which governs the motion of aggregates in disks. Collisional outcomes also depend on the aggregate density. We perform three-dimensional N-body simulations of sequential collisions of aggregates composed of a number of submicron-sized icy particles in order to investigate the density evolution of dust aggregates growing in protoplanetary disks. In the present simulation of sequential collisions , as the initial aggregates at each collision, we use the resultant aggregate obtained at the previous collision. By repeating N-body calculations of aggregate collisions, we examined the density evolution of aggregate collisions. At an early stage of dust growth, aggregates stick to each other without restructuring, and the density of these aggregates decreases. At a later stage, in which the impact energy exceeds a critical energy, aggregates are gradually compressed. The compressed aggregates have a fractal dimension of 2.5. Because of this small fractal dimension, their density remains very low even at this compression stage. We also derive an equation describing the density evolution of growing aggregates. Applying this equation to dust growth in protoplanetary disks, we find that dust aggregates have an extremely low density (<0.1 kg m À3). In the simulation of the present study, we consider only head-on collisions. The effect of oblique collisions would further reduce the aggregate density.

   abstract = {Laboratory experiments on the impact disruption of ice-silicate mixtures were conducted to clarify the accretion process of small icy bodies. Since the icy bodies are composed of ice and silicates with various porosities, we investigated the effect of porosity on the impact disruption of mixtures. We tested the mixture target with the mass ratio of ice to silicate, 0.5 and with 5 different porosities (0, 12.5, 25, 32, 37%) at the impact velocities of 150 to 670 m/s. The silicate mass ratio was changed from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1 at a porosity of 12.5% and a constant impact velocity of about 300 m/s. The impact strength of the mixture was found to decrease with increasing porosity and the silicate mass ratio between 0.1 and 0.5 could enhance the strength of the icy target. The observed dependence of the impact strength on the porosity is opposite to that observed for pure ice. This difference could play an important role in ice-silicate fractionation during the accretion process. Because, ice rich bodies are easily broken as the porosity decreases in their evolution, the collisional growth could be prohibited. On the other hand, among the silicate rich bodies the collisional growth could be enhanced. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reservecd.},

   abstract = {During the last century, the presence of icy particles throughout the universe has been confirmed by numerous ground and space based observations. Ultrathin icy layers are known to cover dust particles within the cold regions of the interstellar medium, and drive a rich chemistry in energetic star-forming regions. The polar caps of terrestrial planets, as well as most of the outer-solar-system satellites, are covered with an icy surface. Smaller solar system bodies, such as comets and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), contain a significant fraction of icy materials. Icy particles are also present in planetary atmospheres and play an important role in determining the climate and the environmental conditions on our host planet, Earth. Water ice seems universal in space and is by far the most abundant condensed-phase species in our universe. Many research groups have focused their efforts on understanding the physical and chemical nature of water ice. However, open questions remain as to whether ices produced in Earth's laboratories are indeed good analogs for ices observed in space environments. Although temperature and pressure conditions can be very well controlled in the laboratory, it is very difficult to simulate the time-scales and gravity conditions of space environments. The bulk structure of ice, and the catalytic properties of the surface, could be rather different when formed in zero gravity in space. The author list comprises the members of the ESA Topical Team: Physico-chemistry of ices in space. In this paper we present recent results including ground-based experiments on ice and dust, models as well as related space experiments performed under microgravity conditions. We also investigate the possibilities of designing a new infrastructure, and /or making improvements to the existing hardware in order to study ices on the International Space Station (ISS). The type of multidisciplinary facility that we describe will support research in crystal growth of ices and other solid refractory materials, aerosol microphysics, light scattering properties of solid particles, the physics of icy particle aggregates, and radiation processing of molecular ices. Studying ices in microgravity conditions will provide us with fundamental data on the nature of extraterrestrial ices and allow us to enhance our knowledge on the physical and chemical processes prevailing in different space environments. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Impact strength and cratering ejecta were studied for porous targets of pure ice and icy-silicate mixture in order to clarify the accumulation and destruction (shattering) condition of small icy bodies. The icy projectile impacted on the cylindrical targets with the porosity up to 55% at a velocity of 150 to 670 m/s at -10°C. The porosity dependence of the impact strength and that of the maximum ejecta velocity were measured in each type of these targets. As a result, the maximum ejecta velocity normalized by the impact velocity (Ve-max/Vi) is found to depend only on the porosity (φ), irrespective of the target type; a relationship is derived to be Ve-max/Vi = -2.17φ + 1.29. The impact strength of pure ice increased with increased target porosity, but that of mixture target had an opposite trend; that is, the strength decreased with increased porosity. These porosity dependencies of the impact strength could be explained by the porosity dependence of the physical parameters such as impact pressure, pressure decay, and static strength. Finally, the accumulation of small icy bodies is discussed to show that the collisional events can be divided into three types by the porosity and the collision velocity according to our experimental results: mass loss, rubble pile formation, and regolith formation (compaction). © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

These have been studied in recent papers. We summarize the main results from these papers and apply them to detailed simulations of the coagulation process and of collisions between dust aggregates. Our results show the following : (1) the growth of aggregates by monomers will normally not involve major restructuring of the aggregates, (2) the classical hit-and-stick assumption is reasonably valid for this case, (3) collisions of aggregates with each other or with large grains can lead to signiÐcant compaction, and (4) the results can be easily understood in terms of critical energies for di †erent restructuring processes.

These values lie significantly above tensile strengths of approx 1.6MPa for ice and of approx 5-6MPa for frozen silt, measured at strain rates of approx 10-2 to 10os-1, but markedly below values found for a variety of rocks at comparable strain rates. Results of the present experiments are used to derive parameters for continuum fracturing models in icy media, which are used to determine relations between tensile strength and strain rate, and to predict stress and damage histories as well as size frequency distribution for ice and ice-silicate fragments. It is found that tensile strength sigma M is related to strain rate which is similar to results obtained for other geological materials. The increase of small fragments relative to larger fragments with increasing strain rate, as predicted by the continuum model, is a result which parallels findings in laboratory impact experiments.-Authors},

Therefore, in continuation of our experiments on mutual decimeter collisions, we investigate collisions of centimeter onto decimeter dust agglomerates in a small drop tower under vacuum conditions (p ≲ 5 × 10-1 mbar) at a mean collision velocity of 6.68 ± 0.67 m s-1. We use quartz dust with irregularly shaped micrometer grains. Centimeter projectiles with different diameters, masses, and heights are used, their typical volume filling factor is Φm = 0.466 ± 0.02. The decimeter agglomerates have a mass of about 1.5 kg, a diameter and height of 12 cm, and a mean filling factor of Φt,m = 0.44 ± 0.004. At lower collision energies, only the projectile gets destroyed and mass is transferred to the target. The accretion efficiency decreases with increasing obliquity and increasing difference in filling factor, if the projectile is more compact than the target. The accretion efficiency increases with increasing collision energy for collision energies under a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold at 298 ± 25 mJ, catastrophic disruption of the target can be observed. This corresponds to a critical fragmentation strength Q∗ = 190 ± 16 mJ kg-1, which is a factor of four larger than expected. Analyses of the projectile fragments show a power-law size distribution with an average exponent of -3.8 ± 0.3. The mass distributions suggest that the fraction of smallest fragments increases for higher collision energies. This is interesting for impacts of small particles on large target bodies within protoplanetary disks, as smaller fragments couple better to the surrounding gas and re-accretion by gas drag is more likely.},

Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing. We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. We use literature data, perform own laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. In our study, we found four different types of sticking, two types of bouncing, and three types of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. We distinguish between eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10^-12 and 10^2 g and collision velocities in the range 10^-4 to 10^4 cm/s for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust.

   abstract = {For dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks, a transition between sticking and bouncing in individual collisions at mm to cm sizes has been observed in the past. This leads to the notion of a bouncing barrier for which growth gets stalled. Here, we present long-term laboratory experiments on the outcome of repeated aggregate collisions at the bouncing barrier. About 100 SiO2 dust aggregates 1 mm in size were observed interacting with each other. Collisions occurred within a velocity range from below mm s-1 up to cm s-1. Aggregates continuously interacted with each other over a period of 900 s. During this time, more than 105 collisions occurred. Nearly 2000 collisions were analyzed in detail. No temporal stable net growth of larger aggregates was observed even though sticking collision occurred. Larger ensembles of aggregates sticking together were formed but were disassembled again during further collisional evolution. The concept of a bouncing barrier supports the formation of planetesimals by seeded collisional growth, as well as by gravitational instability favoring a significant total mass being limited to certain size ranges. Within our parameter set, the experiments confirm that bouncing barriers are one possible and likely evolutionary limit of self-consistent particle growth. © 2014. The American Astronomical Society.

Especially, it is important to study the influence of the velocity of the impacting projectiles. We also want to provide models for dust growth in protoplanetary disks with simple recipes to account for erosion effects. Methods. To study the erosion of dust aggregates we employed a molecular dynamics approach that features a detailed micro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains. For the first time, the model has been extended by introducing a new visco-elastic damping force, which requires a proper calibration. Afterwards, different sample generation methods were used to cover a wide range of aggregate types. Results. The visco-elastic damping force introduced in this work turns out to be crucial to reproduce results obtained from laboratory experiments. After proper calibration, we find that erosion occurs for impact velocities of 5 ms -1 and above. Though fractal aggregates as formed during the first growth phase are most susceptible to erosion, we observe erosion of aggregates with rather compact surfaces as well. Conclusions. We find that bombarding a larger target aggregate with small projectiles results in erosion for impact velocities as low as a few ms-1. More compact aggregates suffer less from erosion. With increasing projectile size the transition from accretion to erosion is shifted to higher velocities. This allows larger bodies to grow through high velocity collisions with smaller aggregates. © 2013 ESO.},

In laboratory experiments, we study the self-consistent evolution of a target upon continuous impacts of submm dust aggregates at collision velocities of up to 71 m/s. Earlier studies analyzed individual collisions, which were more speculative for high velocities and low projectile masses. Here, we confirm earlier findings that high speed collisions result in mass gain of the target. We also quantify the accretion efficiency for the used SiO2 (quartz) dust sample. For two different average masses of dust aggregates (0.29 μg and 2.67 μg) accretion efficiencies are decreasing with velocity from 58% to 18% and from 25% to 7% at 27 m/s to 71 m/s, respectively. The accretion efficiency decreases approximately as logarithmic with impact energy. At the impact velocity of 49 m/s the target acquires a volume filling factor of 38%. These data extend earlier work that pointed to the filling factor leveling off at 8 m/s to a value of 33%. Our results imply that high speed collisions are an important mode of particle evolution.

This ismotivated by the detection ofmid-infrared emission from deep inside a number of dense cores, the so-called 'coreshine,' which is thought to come from scattering by micron (μm)-sized grains. Based on numerical calculations of coagulation starting from the typical grain-size distribution in the diffuse interstellar medium, we obtain a conservative lower limit to the time t to form μm-sized grains: t/tff 3(5/S)(nH/105 cm-3)-1/4 (where tff is the free-fall time at hydrogen number density nH in the core and S the enhancement factor of the grain-grain collision cross-section to account for non-compact aggregates). At the typical core density nH = 105 cm-3, it takes at least a few free-fall times to form the μm-sized grains responsible for coreshine. The implication is that those dense cores observed in coreshine are relatively long-lived entities in molecular clouds, rather than dynamically transient objects that last for one free-fall time or less. © 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Prior to the experiments, we used X-ray computer tomography (nano-CT) imaging to study the internal structure of these dust agglomerates and found no rim compaction so that their collision behavior is not governed by preparation-caused artefacts. We found that collisions between these dust aggregates can lead either to sticking or to bouncing, depending mostly on the impact velocity. While previous collision models derived the transition between both regimes from contact physics, we used the available empirical data from these and earlier experiments to derive a power law relation between dust-aggregate mass and impact velocity for the threshold between the two collision outcomes.

   abstract = {Planet formation occurs within the gas- and dust-rich environments of protoplanetary disks. Observations of these objects show that the growth of primordial submicron-sized particles into larger aggregates occurs at the earliest evolutionary stages of the disks. However, theoretical models of particle growth that use the Smoluchowski equation to describe collisional coagulation and fragmentation have so far failed to produce large particles while maintaining a significant population of small grains. This has generally been attributed to the existence of two barriers impeding growth due to bouncing and fragmentation of colliding particles. In this paper, we demonstrate that the importance of these barriers has been artificially inflated through the use of simplified models that do not take into account the stochastic nature of the particle motions within the gas disk. We present a new approach in which the relative velocities between two particles are described by a probability distribution function that models both deterministic motion (from the vertical settling, radial drift, and azimuthal drift) and stochastic motion (from Brownian motion and turbulence). Taking both into account can give quite different results to what has been considered recently in other studies. We demonstrate the vital effect of two "ingredients" for particle growth: the proper implementation of a velocity distribution function that overcomes the bouncing barrier and, in combination with mass transfer in high-mass-ratio collisions, boosts the growth of larger particles beyond the fragmentation barrier. A robust result of our simulations is the emergence of two particle populations (small and large), potentially explaining simultaneously a number of longstanding problems in protoplanetary disks, including planetesimal formation close to the central star, the presence of millimeter- to centimeter-sized particles far out in the disk, and the persistence of μm-sized grains for millions of years. © 2013.

This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of planet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally bound “planetesimals”, the building blocks of planets.

This work is an extension of our previous experiments reported in Beitz et al. to aggregates of more than one order of magnitude higher masses. The dust aggregates consisted of micrometer-sized silica particles and were macroscopically homogeneous. We measured the coefficient of restitution for collision velocities ranging from 1 cm s-1 to 0.5 m s-1, and determined the fragmentation velocity. For low velocities, the coefficient of restitution decreases with increasing impact velocity, in contrast to findings by Beitz et al. At higher velocities, the value of the coefficient of restitution becomes constant, before the aggregates break at the onset of fragmentation. We interpret the qualitative change in the coefficient of restitution as the transition from a solid-body-dominated to a granular-medium-dominated behavior. We complement our experiments by molecular-dynamics simulations of porous aggregates and obtain a reasonable match to the experimental data. We discuss the importance of our experiments for protoplanetary disks, debris disks, and planetary rings.

Aims. We study the effect of the probability distribution of impact velocities on the collisional dust growth barriers. Methods. We assume a Maxwellian velocity distribution for colliding particles to determine the fraction of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation, and implement this in a dust-size evolution code.

We find that the collisional growth barriers are not as sharp as previously thought. With the existence of low-velocity collisions, a small fraction of the particles manage to grow to masses orders of magnitude above the main population. Conclusions. A particle velocity distribution softens the fragmentation barrier and removes the bouncing barrier.

Very uncertain is still the relative velocity regime in which growth rather than destruction can take place. The outcome of a collision depends on the bulk properties of the porous dust agglomerates. Aims. Continuum models of dust agglomerates require a set of material parameters that are often difficult to obtain from laboratory experiments. Here, we aim at determining those parameters from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our goal is to improve on the existing model that describe the interaction of individual monomers. Methods. We use a molecular dynamics approach featuring a detailed micro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains. The model includes normal forces, rolling, twisting and sliding between the dust grains. We present a new treatment of wall-particle interaction that allows us to perform customized simulations that directly correspond to laboratory experiments. Results. We find that the existing interaction model by Dominik & Tielens leads to a too soft compressive strength behavior for uni-and omni-directional compression. Upon making the rolling and sliding coefficients stiffer we find excellent agreement in both cases. Additionally, we find that the compressive strength curve depends on the velocity with which the sample is compressed. Conclusions. The modified interaction strengths between two individual dust grains will lead to a different behavior of the whole dust agglomerate. This will influences the sticking probabilities and hence the growth of planetesimals. The new parameter set might possibly lead to an enhanced sticking as more energy can be stored in the system before breakup. © 2012 ESO.},

   abstract = {Context. The coagulation of dust particles is the initial step in planetary formation, with the precursors to planetesimals believed to form via the collisions of micron and submicron sized dust particles in the disk surrounding a newly formed protostar. One of the usual assumptions in numerical models of aggregation is that of spherical monomers. However, the polarization of light in the interstellar medium (ISM) indicates that dust particles may not necessarily be spherical. Aims. This study investigates the influence of monomer shape (ellipsoidal vs. spherical) on the morphology of aggregates. The ellipsoidal grains used are prolate with an axis ratio of 3:1:1, which current evidence suggests as a possible shape for instellar dust grains. Methods. Populations of aggregates are built from ellipsoidal monomers and spherical monomers using both particle-cluster aggregation (PCA) and cluster-cluster aggregation (CCA) regimes incorporating the rotation of particles. The morphology of the resulting aggregates is compared using the maximum radius, porosity, fractal dimension, compactness factor and friction time. The last two factors indicate how the dynamics of a population of dust may be altered depending on monomer shape. Results. The results of this study indicate that monomer shape plays an important role in determining the final morphology of aggregates. Comparing ellipsoid grains with 3:1:1 axis ratio to spheres, the greatest difference is seen in compactness factors: (~18%) for the PCA regime, reaching a maximum of (~80%) for the CCA regime. The influence on porosity is also appreciable, (~8%) and (~15%) for PCA and CCA regimes respectively. The resulting differences for the friction times depend on the collision regime employed, yet show a marked difference for the different monomer shapes, (~12%) for PCA and (>50%) for CCA at large sizes. It is concluded that the effect of monomer shape in the hit-and-stick aggregation model may produce appreciable structural variation in the final aggregate. Present models of fluffy aggregates made up of only spherical monomers therefore may not be the best representation for grains in some astrophysical environments. © ESO, 2012.},

It is a rapidly developing field with great promise for diagnostics of both the large-scale structures and the small-scale details of the scattering particles. Aims. For a correct analysis of observations we need to fully understand the effects of dust particle parameters, as well as the effects of the telescope, atmospheric seeing, and assumptions about the data reduction and processing of the observed signal. Here we study the major effects of dust particle structure, size-dependent grain settling, and instrumental properties. Methods. We performed radiative transfer modeling using different dust particle models and disk structures. To study the influence of seeing and telescope diffraction we ran the models through an instrument simulator for the ExPo dual-beam imaging polarimeter mounted at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Results. Particle shape and size have a strong influence on the brightness and detectability of the disks. In the simulated observations, the central resolution element also contains contributions from the inner regions of the protoplanetary disk besides the unpolarized central star. This causes the central resolution element to be polarized, making simple corrections for instrumental polarization difficult. This effect strongly depends on the spatial resolution, so adaptive optics systems are needed for proper polarization calibration. Conclusions. We find that the commonly employed homogeneous sphere model gives results that differ significantly from more realistic models. For a proper analysis of the wealth of data available now or in the near future, one must properly take the effects of particle types and disk structure into account. The observed signal depends strongly on the properties of these more realistic models, thus providing a potentially powerful diagnostic. We conclude that it is important to correctly understand telescope depolarization and calibration effects for a correct interpretation of the degree of polarization. © 2012 ESO.},

Based on these experiments, a dust-aggregate collision model was developed upon which computer simulations were based to evaluate how big protoplanetary dust aggregates can grow and to analyze which kinds of collisions are relevant in the solar nebula and are worth further studies in the laboratory. The sticking threshold velocity of millimeter-sized dust aggregates is one such critical value that have so far only theoretically been derived, as the relevant velocities could not be reached in the laboratory. We developed a microgravity experiment that allows us for the first time to study free collisions of mm-sized dust aggregates down to velocities of ~0.1cms -1 to assess this part of the protoplanetary dust evolution model. Here, we present the results of 125 free collisions between dust aggregates of 0.5-2mm diameter. Seven collisions with velocities between 0.2 and 3cms -1 led to sticking, suggesting a transition from perfect sticking to perfect bouncing with a certain sticking probability instead of a sharp velocity threshold. We developed a model to explain the physical processes involved in dust-aggregate sticking, derived dynamical material properties of the dust aggregates from the results of the collisions, and deduced the velocity below which dust aggregates always stick. For millimeter-sized porous dust aggregates this velocity is 8×10 -5ms -1. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

   abstract = {Context. In the framework of the coagulation scenario, kilometre-sized planetesimals form by subsequent collisions of pre-planetesimals of sizes from centimetre to hundreds of metres. Pre-planetesimals are fluffy, porous dust aggregates, which are inhomogeneous owing to their collisional history. Planetesimal growth can be prevented by catastrophic disruption in pre-planetesimal collisions above the destruction velocity threshold. Aims. We assess whether the inhomogeneity created by subsequent collisions has a significant influence on the stability of pre-planetesimal material to withstand catastrophic disruption. We wish to develop a model that is explicitly able to resolve any inhomogeneous structures. The input parameters of this model must be easily accessible from laboratory measurements. Methods. We develop an inhomogeneity model based on the density distribution of dust aggregates, which is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution with a well-defined standard deviation. As a second input parameter, we consider the typical size of an inhomogeneous clump. For the simulation of the dust aggregates, we utilise a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with extensions for modelling porous solid bodies. The porosity model was previously calibrated for the simulation of SiO 2 dust, which commonly serves as an analogue for pre-planetesimal material. The inhomogeneity is imposed as an initial condition on the SPH particle distribution. We carry out collisions of centimetre-sized dust aggregates of intermediate porosity. We vary the standard deviation of the inhomogeneous distribution at fixed typical clump size. The collision outcome is categorised according to the four-population model. Results. We show that inhomogeneous pre-planetesimals are more prone to destruction than homogeneous aggregates. Even slight inhomogeneities can lower the threshold for catastrophic disruption. For a fixed collision velocity, the sizes of the fragments decrease with increasing inhomogeneity. Conclusions. Pre-planetesimals with an active collisional history tend to be weaker. This is a possible obstacle to collisional growth and needs to be taken into account in future studies of the coagulation scenario. © ESO, 2011.},

We performed laboratory experiments to study the collisional behavior of dust aggregates in this size range at velocities below and around the fragmentation threshold. We developed two independent experimental setups with the same goal: to study the effects of bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer in free particle-particle collisions. The first setup is an evacuated drop tower with a free-fall height of 1.5 m, providing us with 0.56 s of microgravity time, so that we observed collisions with velocities between 8mm s-1 and 2m s-1. The second setup is designed to study the effect of partial fragmentation (when only one of the two aggregates is destroyed) and mass transfer in more detail. It allows for the measurement of the accretion efficiency because the samples are safely recovered after the encounter. At very low velocities, we found that bouncing was as expected, while the fragmentation velocity of 20cm s-1 was significantly lower than expected. We present the critical energy for disruptive collisions Q *, which were at least two orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments in the literature. In the wide range between bouncing and disruptive collisions, only one of the samples fragmented in the encounter, while the other gained mass. The accretion efficiency on the order of a few percentage points of the particle's mass depends on the impact velocity and the sample porosity.

Dullemond & Dominik pointed out for the first time the difficulty in explaining the strong mid-infrared excess of classical T Tauri stars without any dust-retention mechanisms. Because high relative velocities in between micrometer-sized and macroscopic particles exist in protoplanetary disks, we present experimental results on the erosion of macroscopic agglomerates consisting of micrometer-sized spherical particles via the impact of micrometer-sized particles. We find that after an initial phase, in which an impacting particle erodes up to 10 particles of an agglomerate, the impacting particles compress the agglomerate's surface, which partly passivates the agglomerates against erosion. Due to this effect, the erosion halts for impact velocities up to 30ms-1 within our error bars. For higher velocities, the erosion is reduced by an order of magnitude. This outcome is explained and confirmed by a numerical model. In a next step, we build an analytical disk model and implement the experimentally found erosive effect. The model shows that erosion is a strong source of micrometer-sized particles in a protoplanetary disk.

In this article, the emergent collision model for protoplanetery dust aggregates (G\"uttler et al. 2010) as well as the numerical model for the evolution of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks (Zsom et al. 2010) are reviewed. It turns out that, after a brief period of rapid collisional growth of fluffy dust aggregates to sizes of a few centimeters, the protoplanetary dust particles are subject to bouncing collisions, in which their porosity is considerably decreased. The model results also show that low-velocity fragmentation can reduce the final mass of the dust aggregates but that it does not trigger a new growth mode as discussed previously. According to the current stage of our model, the direct formation of kilometer-sized planetesimals by collisional sticking seems impossible so that collective effects, such as the streaming instability and the gravitational instability in dust-enhanced regions of the protoplanetary disk, are the best candidates for the processes leading to planetesimals.},

   abstract = {In recent years, a number of new experiments have advanced our knowledge on the early growth phases of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Some of these experiments have shown that collisions between porous and compacted agglomerates at velocities above the fragmentation threshold velocity can lead to growth of the compact body, when the porous collision partner fragments upon impact and transfers mass to the compact agglomerate. To obtain a deeper understanding of this potentially important growth process, we performed laboratory and drop tower experiments to study multiple impacts of small, highly porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. The projectile and target consisted of 1.5 μm monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with volume filling factors of 0.15 ± 0.01 and 0.45 ± 0.05, respectively. The fragile projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a projectile magazine with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in vacuum.We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m s-1. The experiments at the lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop tower under microgravity conditions to allow partial mass transfer also for the lowest adhesion case. Within this velocity range, we found a linear increase of the accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments, the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the target after less than 100 impacts. From the images, we also measured the volume filling factors of the grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly compacted) with increasing impact speed. The velocity dependency of the mass-transfer efficiency and the packing density of the resulting aggregates augment our knowledge of the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account for future models of protoplanetary dust growth. © 2010 The American Astronomical Society.},

The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Aims. We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. Methods. We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous "phases" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom & Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. Results. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10-4during the simulations. Conclusions. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to π 1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {The growth of planetesimals is an essential step in planet formation. Decimetre-size dust agglomerates mark a transition point in this growth process. In laboratory experiments we simulated the formation, evolution, and properties of decimetre-scale dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs. Small sub-mm size dust aggregates consisting of micron-size SiO2 particles randomly interacted with dust targets of varying initial conditions in a continuous sequence of independent collisions. Impact velocities were 7.7 m/s on average and in the range expected for collisions with decimetre bodies in protoplanetary discs. The targets all evolved by forming dust crusts with up to several cm thickness and a unique filling factor of 31% ± 3%. A part of the projectiles sticks directly. In addition, some projectile fragments slowly return to the target by gravity. All initially porous parts of the surface, i.e. built from the slowly returning fragments, are compacted and firmly attached to the underlying dust layers by the subsequent impacts. Growth is possible at impact angles from 0° (central collision) to 70°. No growth occurs at steeper dust surfaces. We measured the velocity, angle, and size distribution of collision fragments. The average restitution coefficient is 3.8% or 0.29 m/s ejection velocity. Ejecta sizes are comparable to the projectile sizes. The high filling factor is close to the most compact configuration of dust aggregates by local compression (∼33%). This implies that the history of the surface formation and target growth is completely erased. In view of this, the filling factor of 31% seems to be a universal value in the collision experiments of all self-consistently evolving targets at the given impact velocities. We suggest that decimetre and probably larger bodies can simply be characterised by one single filling factor. While gravity dominates re-accretion in the experiments, small fragments will be re-accreted as well in protoplanetary discs by gas drag at the given low ejection velocities. The accretion efficiency in planetesimal growth is model dependent. However, a small fraction of small particles re-accreted by gas flow or direct sticking readily allows growth of dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs in the decimetre range. © 2009 ESO.},

   abstract = {Context. Analysis of thermal dust emission spectra for dust mineralogy and physical grain properties depends on comparison spectra, which are either laboratory-measured infrared extinction spectra or calculated extinction cross sections based on certain grain models. Often, the agreement between these two kinds of spectra, if available, is not yet satisfactory because of the strong influence of the grain morphology on the spectra. Aims. We investigate the ability of the statistical light-scattering model with a distribution of form factors (DFF) to reproduce measured infrared dust extinction spectra for particles that are small compared to the wavelength, i.e. in the size range of 1 μm and smaller. Methods. We take advantage of new experimental spectra measured for free particles dispersed in air with accompanying information on the grain morphology. For the calculations, we used DFFs that were derived for aggregates of spherical grains, as well as for compact grain shapes corresponding to Gaussian random spheres. In addition we used a fitting algorithm to obtain the best-fit DFFs for the various laboratory samples. In this way we can independently derive information on the shape of the grains from their infrared spectra. Results. With the DFF model, we achieve an adequate fit of the experimental IR spectra. The differences in the IR band profiles between the spectra of particulates with different grain shapes are simply reflected by different DFFs. Irregular particle shapes require a DFF similar to that of a Gaussian Random Sphere with σ, whereas roundish grain shapes are best fitted with that of a fractal aggregate of Df = 2.4-1.8. The fitted DFFs generally reproduce the measured spectral shapes quite well. For anisotropic materials, different DFFs are needed for the different crystallographic axes. The implications of this finding are discussed. Conclusions. The use of this model could be a step forward toward more realistic comparison data in infrared spectral analysis of thermal dust emission spectra, provided that these spectra are dominated by emission from submicron grains. © 2009 ESO.},

   abstract = {To study the evolution of protoplanetary dust aggregates, we performed experiments with up to 2600 collisions between single, highly porous dust aggregates and a solid plate. The dust aggregates consisted of spherical SiO2 grains with 1.5 μm diameter and had an initial volume filling factor (the volume fraction of material) of φ0 = 0.15. The aggregates were put onto a vibrating baseplate and, thus, performed multiple collisions with the plate at a mean velocity of 0.2 m s-1. The dust aggregates were observed by a high-speed camera to measure their size which apparently decreased over time as a measure for their compaction. After 1000 collisions the volume filling factor was increased by a factor of 2, while after 2000 collisions it converged to an equilibrium of φ 0.36. In few experiments the aggregate fragmented, although the collision velocity was well below the canonical fragmentation threshold of 1 m s-1. The compaction of the aggregate has an influence on the surface-to-mass ratio and thereby the dynamic behavior and relative velocities of dust aggregates in the protoplanetary nebula. Moreover, macroscopic material parameters, namely, the tensile strength, shear strength, and compressive strength, are altered by the compaction of the aggregates, which has an influence on their further collisional behavior. The occurrence of fragmentation requires a reassessment of the fragmentation threshold velocity. © 2009 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

Dust projectiles much larger than 1 mm lead to a small amount of erosion of the target but decimetre targets do not break up. Collisions produce ejecta, which are smaller than the incoming projectile. Projectiles smaller than 1 mm are accreted by a target even at the highest collision velocities.

   abstract = {We carry out numerical simulations of dust aggregate collisions to study the compression and disruption processes of aggregates in their growth. To compare with the pioneering studies of Dominik & Tielens, we focus on two-dimensional head-on collisions, in which we obtain similar results for compression and disruption to theirs. In addition to the similarities, we examine the dependence of the collisional outcomes on the aggregate size and the parameters relevant to the particle interaction in detail by treating large aggregates that consist of up to 2000 particles. Compression of aggregates by collisions reduces the radius of gyration and increases the number of contacts between the constituent particles. Our results show that the changes in the gyration radius and the number of contacts after impact depend on the impact energy and that the dependence is scaled by the energy necessary to roll all contacts. We provide empirical formulae for the changes in the gyration radius and the number of contacts. Furthermore, we find that the degree of maximum compression is determined by the ratio of rolling energy to breaking energy. This indicates that ice aggregates become more compact than quartz aggregates in the same impact conditions. Any aggregates are catastrophically disrupted when the impact energy exceeds approximately 10 times the energy necessary to break all contacts. Our results, however, suggest that it becomes harder to disrupt the aggregates with an increasing number of particles.

   abstract = {Context. Sticking of colliding dust particles through van der Waals forces is the first stage in the grain growth process in protoplanetary disks, eventually leading to the formation of comets, asteroids and planets. A key aspect of the collisional evolution is the coupling between dust and gas motions, which depends on the internal structure (porosity) of aggregates. Aims. To quantify the importance of the internal structure on the collisional evolution of particles, and to create a new coagulation model to investigate the difference between porous and compact coagulation in the context of a turbulent protoplanetary disk. Methods. We have developed simple prescriptions for the collisional evolution of porosity of grain-aggregates in grain-grain collisions. Three regimes can then be distinguished: "hit-and-stick" at low velocities, with an increase in porosity; compaction at intermediate velocities, with a decrease of porosity; and fragmentation at high velocities. This study has been restricted to physical regimes where fragmentation is unimportant. The temporal evolution has been followed using a Monte Carlo coagulation code. Results. This collision model is applied to the conditions of the (gas dominated) protoplanetary disk, with an αT parameter characterising the turbulent viscosity. We can discern three different stages in the particle growth process. Initially, growth is driven by Brownian motion and the relatively low velocities involved lead to a rapid increase in porosity of the growing aggregate. The subsequent second stage is characterised by much higher, turbulent driven velocities and the particles compact. As they compact, their mass-to-surface area increases and eventually they enter the third stage, the settling out to the mid-plane. We find that when compared to standard, compact models of coagulation, porous growth delays the onset of settling, because the surface area-to-mass ratio is higher, a consequence of the build-up of porosity during the initial stages. As a result, particles grow orders of magnitudes larger in mass before they rain-out to the mid-plane. Depending on the precise value of αT and on the position in the nebula, aggregates can grow to (porous) sizes of ∼10 cm in a few thousand years. We also find that collisional energies are higher than in the limited PCA/CCA fractal models, thereby allowing aggregates to restructure. It is concluded that the microphysics of collisions plays a key role in the growth process. © ESO 2006.},

The interstellar dust in this material is a mixture of species which does not correspond to any kind of chemical equilibrium state between the solid and gaseous phases. Mass accretion carries this material into the warm inner disc zones where chemical and physical processes are activated which convert the non-equilibrium solid-gas mixture into a chemical equilibrium mixture. Part of the equilibrated material is then mixed outwards by turbulent diffusion and large-scale circulation currents. This work specifically considers the evolution of the main dust components, viz. from the interstellar mixture of amorphous Mg-Fe-silicates, into a chemical equilibrium mixture of crystalline Mg-silicates, and iron. The basic set of equations for calculating the evolution of a mixture of silicates and iron is derived. Model calculations based on stationary, one-zone α-discs are combined with the advection-diffusion-reaction equations for the dust evolution to study the interstellar to equilibrium dust conversion and the radial mixing of equilibrated dust into the outer disc regions. This determines the mixture of the main dust components which form the mineral inventory of planetesimals. It is found that the results of the model calculation for the resulting mineral mixture are in rough agreement with the composition of matrix material of primitive meteorites and dust in cometary nuclei.},

The main objective of the CODAG experiment was a direct observation of the Brownian motion-induced co-agulation process of micron-sized dust particles. To overcome rapid sedimentation of the dust grains in the rarefied gas atmosphere, experiments were conducted in a long-duration microgravity environment. In the experiment, we observed that within several minutes the initially deagglomerated dust grains formed fractal dust aggregates due to their thermal motion and subsequent mutual collisions. The results from this experiment are the first experimental proof that the concept of pre-planetary dust coagulation is correct. INTRODUCTION For the formation of planetesimals, the km-sized precursors of planets, circumstellar dust grains need to agglomerate. In the initial phase, pm-sized dust particles collide due to their Brownian motion and stick to each other due to van der Waals forces (Weidenschilling and Cuzzi, 1993). The growth rate of the pm-planetary dust in this stage depends strongly on the structure of the dust aggregates, which is not self-consistently predictable.

Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force Froll=1.2×10-9 N and for the break-up energy Ebr=1.3×10-15 J (valid for 1.9-μm-diameter SiO2 spheres) are used.

   abstract = {An experimental setup, based on the principles of atomic force microscopy (AFM), was used to measure directly the adhesion and rolling-friction forces between individual silica microspheres of radii between 0.5 and 2.5 mm. It showed that the linear dependence of the pull-off force on the particle radius is still valid for micron-sized particles. Rolling-friction forces between silica microspheres were measured for the first time by combining AFM methods and optical microscopy: They are 100 times lower than the corresponding adhesion forces. PACS numbers: 81.40.Pq, 61.16.Ch, 83.70.Fn Adhesion and friction forces between small particles are important for a variety of natural phenomena and industrial processes. Examples are the aggregation and dispersal of powders and colloidal dispersions, and the flow properties of granular materials. Our particular interest was raised by the lack of knowledge on cosmic dust ag-gregation as a first step in planet formation. Depending on the adhesion forces, friction forces, and impact velocities , collisions between dust aggregates in the preplanetary nebula result in the formation of fluffy fractal structures, of compact aggregates, or in fragmentation [1]. In order to understand and predict the aggregation of small particles, the vertical and tangential forces between two particles in contact need to be known. When two particles in vacuum or in a gaseous environment come close, they usually experience attractive forces such as the van der Waals force. Once in contact, they are inevitably deformed due to their finite elasticity. Contact between two solid spheres is usually described by the model of Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts (JKR) [2] or by the model of Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov (DMT) [3]. Both models are based on an earlier analysis by Hertz, who considered two elastic bodies in contact under an external load but ignored attractive interparticle forces [4]. In the JKR approach, the effective steady-state pressure in the contact circle is assumed to be the superposition of elastic Hertzian pressure and of attractive surface forces which act only over the contact area. As a result, a tensile force is necessary to separate the adhering particles. This pull-off force between two spherical particles is given by F JKR 3pRg. (1) Here g is the effective solid surface energy and R is the reduced radius of curvature of the two surfaces, R R 1 R 2 R 1 1 R 2 , with R 1 and R 2 being the individual particle radii. DMT published an alternative theory which also accounts for noncontact forces in the vicinity of the contact area. It predicts a slightly higher pull-off force of F DMT 4pRg. (2) In the JKR and DMT models, the separation force between two spherical particles is independent of the elastic material properties but is a linear function of the particle size and the surface energy. It turned out that both models are limiting cases of a more general description [5]. The JKR model is appropriate for large, soft bodies with high surface energies. For small, hard solid particles with low surface energy, the DMT model should be applied [6,7]. For silica SiO 2 microspheres considered in this paper, the DMT model is expected to give more realistic adhesion values. The main results of JKR theory have been verified experimentally for relatively soft materials and surfaces with large radii [8-11]. For particles with R , 0.1 mm, experimental results are rather limited. Rimai et al. [12] found that the contact radii for soft E 10 6 Nm 2 and small 3 mm # R # 100 mm bodies do not depend on R as predicted by theory. Adhesion forces between particles and planar surfaces have been measured with the centrifugal method [13-16]. A significant part of the knowledge about the behavior of powders stems from such experiments, which are, however, restricted to particles larger than 5 mm. Otherwise, the centrifugal force is not strong enough to detach the adhering particles from the surface. Enachescu et al. [17] verified the relation between contact area and load predicted by DMT theory with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Using electrically conducting tips and assuming that the conductance is proportional to the contact area, they found reasonable agreement between measured and calculated results. With the invention of the atomic force microscope [18] the interaction between individual small particles could for the first time be measured repeatedly and in detail [19-21].

   abstract = {The behavior of solid particles in a low-mass solar nebula during settling to the central plane and the formation of planetesimals is examined. Gravitational instability in a dust layer and collisional accretion are considered as possible mechanisms of planetesimal formation. Non-Keplerian rotation of the nebula results in shear between the gas and a dust layer. This shear produces turbulence within the layer which inhibits gravitational instability, unless the mean particle size exceeds a critical value,-l cm at l AU. The size requirement is less stringent at larger heliocentric distances, suggesting a possible difference in planetesimal formation mechanisms between the inner and outer nebula. Coagulation of grains during settling is expected in the solar nebula environment. Van der Waals forces appear adequate to produce centimeter-sized aggregates. Growth is primarily due to sweepup of small particles by larger ones due to size-dependent settling velocities. A numerical model for computing simultaneous coagulation and settling is described. Relative velocities are determined by gas drag and the non-Keplerian rotation of the nebula. The settling is very nonhomologous. Most of the solid matter reaches the central plane as centimeter-sized aggregates in a few times l0 a revolutions, but some remains suspended in the form of fine dust. Drag-induced relative velocities result in collisions. The growth of bodies in the central plane is initially rapid. Atter sizes reach-10 a cm, relative velocities decrease and the growth rate declines. Gas drag rapidly damps the out-of-plane motions of these intermediate-sized bodies. They settle into a thin layer which is subject to gravitational instability. Kilometer-sized planetesimals are formed by this composite process.},

[2010]. Astron. Astrophys., 513, A57). Laboratory experiments have shown that dust aggregates of these sizes stick to one another only at unreasonably low velocities. However, in the protoplanetary disk, millimeter-sized particles are known to have been ubiquitous. One can find relics of them in the form of solid chondrules as the main constituent of chondrites. Most of these chondrules were found to feature a fine-grained rim, which is hypothesized to have formed from accreting dust grains in the solar nebula. To study the influence of these dust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly planetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized, dust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cms -1. For 2 and 3mm diameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of 0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cms -1. This velocity is higher than the sticking velocity of dust aggregates of the same size. We therefore conclude that chondrules may be an important step towards a deeper understanding of the collisional growth of larger bodies. Moreover, we analyzed the collision behavior in an ensemble of dust aggregates and non-coated chondrule analogs. While neither the dust aggregates nor the solid chondrule analogs show sticking in collisions among their species, we found an enhanced sicking efficiency in collisions between the two constituents, which leads us to the conjecture that chondrules might act as " catalyzers" for the growth of larger bodies in the young Solar System. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Due to its high abundance, it contributes heavily to the collisional evolution in this region of the disk. For the first time, we carried out laboratory collision experiments with CO2 ice particles and a CO2-covered wall at a temperature of 80 K. Collision velocities varied between 0 and 2.5 m s-1. Particle sizes were on the order of ? 100 ?m. We find a threshold velocity between the sticking and the bouncing regime at 0.04 m s-1. Particles with greater velocities, but below 1 m s-1, bounce off the wall. For yet greater velocities, fragmentation occurs. We give analytical models for the coefficients of restitution and fragmentation strength consistent with the experimental data. Set in context, our data show that CO2 ice and silicate dust resemble each other in the collisional behavior. Compared to water ice, the sticking velocity is an order of magnitude smaller. One immediate consequence as an example is that water-ice particles mantled by CO2 ice lose any "sticking advantage." In this case, preferential planetesimal growth attributed to the sticking properties of water ice will be limited to the region between the H2O ice line and the CO2 ice line.},

   abstract = {The C/O ratio is predicted to regulate the atmospheric chemistry in hot Jupiters. Recent observations suggest that some exoplanets, e.g., Wasp 12-b, have atmospheric C/O ratios substantially different from the solar value of 0.54. In this Letter, we present a mechanism that can produce such atmospheric deviations from the stellar C/O ratio. In protoplanetary disks, different snowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon monoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas and in the condensed phases. In particular, between the H2O and CO snowlines most oxygen is present in icy grains - the building blocks of planetary cores in the core accretion model - while most carbon remains in the gas phase. This region is coincidental with the giant-planet-forming zone for a range of observed protoplanetary disks. Based on standard core accretion models of planet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from disk gas outside of the water snowline will have a C/O ∼ 1, while atmospheres significantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have a stellar or substellar C/O when formed at the same disk radius. The overall metallicity will also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how a specific planet formed. © 2011.

Both the HIFI and PACS instruments are used to observe a variety of lines of H 2 O, H 2 18 O and chemically related species at the source position and in small maps around the protostars and selected outflow positions. In addition, high-frequency lines of CO, 13 CO, and C 18 O are obtained with Herschel and are complemented by ground-based observations of dust continuum, HDO, CO and its isotopologs, and other molecules to ensure 16 a self-consistent data set for analysis. An overview of the scientific motivation and observational strategy of the program is given, together with the modeling approach and analysis tools that have been developed. Initial science results are presented. These include a lack of water in cold gas at abundances that are lower than most predictions, strong water emission from shocks in protostellar environments, the importance of UV radiation in heating the gas along outflow walls across the full range of luminosities, and surprisingly widespread detection of the chemically related hydrides OH þ and H 2 O þ in outflows and foreground gas. Quantitative estimates of the energy budget indicate that H 2 O is generally not the dominant coolant in the warm dense gas associated with protostars. Very deep limits on the cold gaseous water reservoir in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks are obtained that have profound implications for our understanding of grain growth and mixing in disks.},

   abstract = {The surface density profile AE(r) of the solar nebula protoplanetary disk is a fundamental input to all models of disk processes and evolution. Traditionally it is estimated by spreading out the augmented masses of the planets over the annuli in which the planets orbit today, the so-called minimum-mass solar nebula. Doing so implicitly assumes that the planets completely accreted all planetesimals in their feeding zones, but this assumption has not been tested. Indeed, models of the growth of Uranus and Neptune predict that these planets could not have grown to $10 M È within the lifetime of the disk, even though they must have, to accrete H /He atmospheres. In this paper we adopt the starting positions of the planets in the ''Nice'' model of planetary dynamics (Tsiganis and coworkers), in which the solar system started in a much more compact configuration. We derive a surface density profile that is well approximated by the power law AE(r) ¼ 343(f p /0:5) À1 (r/10 AU) À2:168 g cm À2 , where f p is the fraction of the solid mass in the form of planetesimals. We show that this profile is inconsistent with a steady state accretion disk but is consistent with a steady state decretion disk that is being photoevaporated. We calculate the growth of planets in the context of this disk model and demonstrate for the first time that all of the giant planets can achieve their isolation masses and begin to accrete H/He atmospheres within the lifetime of the disk. The fit of our inferred AE(r) to the augmented masses of the planets is excellent (<10%), but only if Uranus and Neptune swtiched places early in the solar system's evolution , a possibility predicted by the Nice model.},

This suggests that most planet formation occurred in environments unheated by stellar radiation. Viewing the system at any single wavelength increases the apparent Ñaring of the disk but leaves the shadow radius essentially unchanged. External heating further enhances Ñaring at large radii, but, except under extreme illumination (100 K), the inner disk will shield the planet-forming regions of all but the lowest mass Ñux disks from radiation originating near the origin such as from the star or from an FU Orionis outburst.},

We present a new collision model that treats adhesion and viscoelasticity self-consistently, while energy losses arising from plastic deformation are assumed to be additive. Results show that viscoelasticity can significantly increase the energy that is dissipated in a collision, enhancing the sticking velocity. Furthermore, collisions well above the sticking velocity remain dissipative. We systemically compare the model to a large and unbiased set of published laboratory experiments to show its general applicability. The model is well capable of reproducing the important relation between impact velocity and COR as measured in the experiments, covering a wide range of materials, particle sizes, and collision velocities. Furthermore, the fitting parameters from those curves provide physical parameters such as the surface energy, yield strength, and characteristic viscous relaxation time. Our results show that all three aspects - adhesion, viscoelastic dissipation and plastic deformation - are required for a proper description of the kinetic energy losses in sphere collisions. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

From the trajectories of the particles, obtained by image analysis, we can determine both the restitution coefficient and the time decay of the energy in the medium as soon as the vibration is cut off. We found evidence at low velocities of a positive slope of the restitution coefficient vs. the impact velocity, contrary to the usual approach where it only decreases with the velocity. We also found that the experimental cooling time is also much shorter than the one predicted on the basis of constant or decreasing restitution coefficient. A better agreement between theory and experiment is found if we take into account either the rotational degree of freedom or the velocity dependence of the coefficient of restitution. © EPLA, 2009.},

   abstract = {In order to find reliable collector surfaces for the Mesospheric Aerosol - Genesis, Interaction and Composition (MAGIC) sounding rocket experiment, intended to collect atmospheric nanoparticles, the sticking efficiency of nanoparticles was measured on several targets of different materials. The nanoparticles were generated by a molecular beam apparatus in Jena, Germany, by laser ablation (Al2O3 particles, diameter 5-50 nm) and by laser pyrolysis (carbon particles, diameter 10-20 nm). In a vacuum environment (>10-5 mbar) the particles condensed from the gas phase, formed a particle beam, and were accelerated to ∼ 1 km/s. The sticking efficiency on the target materials carbon, gold and grease was measured by a microbalance. Results demonstrate moderate to high sticking probabilities. Thus, the capture and retrieval of atmospheric nanoparticles was found to be quantitatively feasible. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

   abstract = {Freeze-out of the gas-phase elements onto cold grains in dense interstellar and circumstellar media builds up ice mantles consisting of molecules that are mostly formed in situ (H2O, NH3, CO2, CO, CH3OH, and more). This review summarizes the detected infrared spectroscopic ice features and compares the abundances across Galactic, extragalactic, and Solar System environments. A tremendous amount of information is contained in the ice band profiles. Laboratory experiments play a critical role in the analysis of the observations. Strong evidence is found for distinct ice formation stages, separated by CO freeze-out at high densities. The ice bands have proven to be excellent probes of the thermal history of their environment. The evidence for the long-held idea that processing of ices by energetic photons and cosmic rays produces complex molecules is weak. Recent state-of-the-art observations show promise for much progress in this area with planned infrared facilities.},
