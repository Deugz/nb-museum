   abstract = {Context. The sticking of micron-sized dust particles caused by surface forces within circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets. The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Aims. We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. Methods. We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous "phases" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom & Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. Results. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10-4during the simulations. Conclusions. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to π 1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {There is limited time for the dust in the nebula around a newborn star to form planetesimals: in a few million years or less the star's stellar winds will disperse most of the unagglomerated dust. It has been difficult to explain the efficiency by which dust grains must have agglomerated to form planetesimals in circumstellar disks. A major obstacle is the fragility of aggregates, leading to collisional fragmentation, which makes it difficult for them to grow to, and beyond, meter-sized bodies. The distinct properties of cryogenic (5-100 K) amorphous water ice, which composes or coats the grains in the cooler parts of the nebulae (kJovian distances), may be able to account for the rapid agglomeration. Measurements are presented that show that this ice readily acquires persistent macroscopic electric dipoles, strongly enhancing grain-grain adhesion. In addition, measurements were made showing that vapor-deposited amorphous water ice is also highly mechanically inelastic (%10% rebound). Together these may explain this efficient net sticking and net growth. Similar properties of higher temperature grains may aid agglomeration in the inner regions of the nebulae.},

   abstract = {(abridged) In the core accretion scenario for the formation of planetary rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although dust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of interstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and kilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the formation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in young extrasolar systems. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures are summarized. We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the initial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence for the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent evidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a brief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size distribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations. The observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models, in particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks. We also highlight the limits of current models, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains.},

   abstract = {We present the 1.9-4.2 μm spectra of the five bright (L ≤ 11.2) young stars associated with silhouette disks with a moderate to high inclination angle of 39°-80° in the M42 and M43 regions. The water ice absorption is seen toward d121-1925 and d216-0939, while the spectra of d182-316, d183-405, and d218-354 show no water ice feature around 3.1 μm within the detection limits. By comparing the water ice features toward nearby stars, we find that the water ice absorption toward d121-1925 and d216-0939 most likely originates from the foreground material and the surrounding disk, respectively. The angle of the disk inclination is found to be mainly responsible for the difference of the optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest that there is a critical inclination angle between 65° and 75° for the circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average density at the disk surface of d216-0939 was found to be 6.38 × 10-18gcm-3. The water ice absorption band in the d216-0939 disk is remarkable in that the maximum optical depth of the water ice band is at a longer wavelength than detected before. It indicates that the primary carrier of the feature is purely crystallized water ice at the surface of the d216-0939 disk with characteristic size of 0.8 μm, which suggests grain growth.

   abstract = {Moderate-resolution infrared spectra (A/AA ~ 160) from 2.4 to 3.8 /mi have been obtained for a selection of infrared protostars and one object located behind the Taurus dark cloud. The strong absorption at 3.08 /an has already been identified with H 2 0 ice by previous observations. However, we find that a comparison of the shape of this feature with a simple H 2 0 ice model provides constraints on the temperature of the ice-coated grains. For example, the spectra of GL 961, GL 989, Mon R2/IRS 2, and Elias 16 are characteristic of absorption by H 2 0 ice at temperatures lower than ~30 K, while those of BN, Mon R2/IRS 3, and GL 2591 suggest H 2 0 ice temperatures greater than 70 K. In addition, the model shows that absorption which cannot be explained by H 2 0 ice exists on both sides of the 3.08 /un feature. This additional absorption consists of at least three distinct features with maxima near 2.85 /mi, 3.3 /mi, and 3.45 /mi. A common explanation for absorption near 3.4 /mi is a mixture of H 2 0 and NH 3 ices, but higher resolution observations (2/A2 ~ 640) did not detect the N-H stretching vibration of NH 3 near 2.963 /mi in either BN or GL 989. Other explanations , such as hydrated silicates or scattering effects can also be ruled out for the 3.3 and 3.45 /mi features, although they could contribute to the absorption near 2.85 /mi. The most plausible explanation for the 3.3 and 3.45 /¿m features appears to be some form of hydrocarbons, although we cannot identify the features we observe with any other hydrocarbon feature observed astronomically. However, with this explanation, the 3.3 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in aromatic CH subgroups while the 3.45 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in CH 3 and CH 2 subgroups. Finally, O-H stretching vibrations seem to provide the most plausible explanation for the 2.85 /mi feature. This could be the result of dilution of the H 2 0 ice by other molecules, where the bonds formed between the H 2 0 and the diluting molecules have shifted the position of the O-H stretching vibration to wavelengths shorter than 3.08 /mi (i.e., the O-H stretch in pure H 2 0 ice).},

   abstract = {The cooling efficiencies of various fluids at low temperature were compared by measuring the temperature decay in 3 μl water samples plunged into them. A simple model of cooling was used in order to discuss the results. Liquid ethane was found to produce a cooling rate of 660 K s−1, about twice that of liquid propane, while ethanol was almost as effective as ethane between 273 to 223 K. The heat‐transfer coefficient of liquid ethane was estimated to be between 1500 and 5000 W m−2 K−1, depending on the physical state assumed for the water sample. Samples of flagellated organisms, after being frozen rapidly in the above way, were freeze‐substituted by the method of Barlow & Sleigh (1979). Although this fixation did not give good definition of the microtubules of the flagellar axoneme, it exhibited reasonable tissue preservation in thin sections of the cell body. The fixation method resulted in preserved flagellar wave shapes, which were observed under the light microscope and in critical‐point dried cells examined by scanning and conventional electron microscopy. It was concluded (a) that methods for preserving the wave shape of the flagellum and for preserving its internal structure may not be compatible, and (b) that although the present cooling method (with ethane) approaches the speed required to arrest a flagellar wave, further improvements in the speed of the method are desirable. 1982 Blackwell Science Ltd},

The transition has great sensitivity to end effects; but in contrast another, more easily recorded property was found to be surprisingly insensitive to them. Expressed as a multiple of !1, the angular speed w/ n of the observed travelling waves turned out to be nearly independent of R, as shown in Fig. 2 which includes values of w/n!l from all our measurements of frequency. The mean value is about 0.32, which is unexpectedly close to corresponding values found previously by others from observations in apparatus with r an order of magnitude larger, for example the value 0.34 found by Coles 9 • Considered alone, this property might thus be deceptive as regards the overall importance of end effects.

   abstract = {The terrestrial planets and the asteroids dominant in the inner asteroid belt are water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have decreased below water-condensation level well before the disk was photo-evaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is puzzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be direct condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the Sun more slowly than the gas itself. Thus the gas in the vicinity of the snowline always comes from farther out, where it should have already condensed, and therefore it should be dry. The appearance of ice in a range of heliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial drift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a planet with a mass larger than 20 Earth mass is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because such a planet gives the disk a super-Keplerian rotation just outside of its own orbit. From this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved this threshold mass when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively fossilized the snowline at that location. In fact, even if it cooled later, the disk inside of Jupiter's orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from the outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that planetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in their inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the planetesimal disk at 0.7 AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to explain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its orbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of the phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus, when the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7. AU without being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing planetesimals.},

We present a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions of planetary building blocks that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it. The chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one where an element condenses when the mid-plane temperature in the disc is lower than the 50 per cent condensation temperature ($\rm T_\{50\}$) of that element and the other where the condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with some systematic differences of ∼10 per cent depending upon the radial distance and an element's condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling time-scale of the dust is of the order of the evolution time-scale of the disc or longer. If the decoupling time-scale is too short, the composition deviates significantly from the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the chemical compositions of chondrites, and ultimately the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, and may constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.},

In this Review, we discuss breakthroughs in geochemistry and theoretical modelling that have advanced understanding of Earth accretion. Theory holds that solar nebula dust particles stuck together to form pebbles, concentrations of which gravitationally collapsed into ∼100-km-sized planetesimals, which in turn accreted to yield planets. Isotopic variations in meteorites indicate that pebbles formed within the first 100 kyr of the Solar System, planetesimals melted and differentiated within a few 100 kyr, and Mars accreted quickly within 5 Myr. Earth’s growth was more protracted, with >98% of its mass being accreted by the time of the Moon-forming Giant Impact at ∼70–120 Myr. Earth is more enriched in s-process nuclides than chondritic meteorites, with a chemical composition affected by condensation, melting and loss. Early volatiles acquired from the nebula largely escaped, with the remnant volatiles being diluted by main-stage Earth accretion, accompanied by loss of nitrogen to the core and/or space. Areas for further research should include assessing mixing during large collisions and investigating the origin of very early mantle isotopic heterogeneities, which might indicate mass transfer from core to mantle over time.},

With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. Methods. We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Results. We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10-12and 102g and collision velocities in the range of 10-4$\ldots$ 104cm s-1for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. Conclusions. We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust. This collision model can be used for the determination of the dust-growth rate in protoplanetary disks. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {Water ice is one of the most abundant materials in dense molecular clouds and in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials (e.g., silicates), water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have been scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-sized region and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup to grow aggregates composed of μm-sized water-ice particles, which we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at different temperatures between 114K and 260 K. We show with our experiments that for low temperatures (below ∼210 K), μm-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold velocity of 9.6 m s-1, which is approximately 10 times higher than the sticking threshold of μm-sized silica particles. Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities above 15.3 m s-1. A comparison of the experimentally derived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the presence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance the growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.},

   abstract = {Sintering is a process driven by mass transport that leads to the formation of a sinter neck between neighbouring particles. The temporal growth of the neck area can lead to an increase of the mechanical strength and increased heat conductivity of granular icy surfaces on Solar System bodies. For water ice, sublimation is closely connected to the sinter process, because it drives the mass transport from the particles in contact to their neck region. Here, we report on novel experiments conducted to investigate the sinter and the sublimation processes of micrometre-sized water-ice particles with the help of a cryogenically cooled scanning electron microscope. Based on these experiments, we developed a sinter model based on which the sintering influence on the tensile strength, the compressive strength, and the thermal conductivity of icy surfaces on Solar System objects can be derived. Applied to comets, we find that the sinter process is faster than the typical erosion rates of cometary surfaces, implying that the uppermost icy surface layers are thermally processed. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is warm enough to experience sintering during its lifetime, whereas the sinter time-scale of Saturn's moon Enceladus is longer than the age of our Solar System.},

   abstract = {The vitrification of pure liquid water by projecting a thin jet of liquid water at high speed into a liquid cryomedium is reported. The influence of the experimental parameters on the cooling rate and the devitrification of the jet-frozen vitrified material have been investigated. A structural difference between vitrified liquid water and amorphous solid water prepared from the vapour phase is inferred from a comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns. FINDING a method for vitrifying pure liquid water is important for several reasons. The investigation of vitrified liquid water will help to elucidate the structure of liquid water because the effects of thermal and static disorder can be largely separated 1-4. It might help in interpreting the anomalous properties of super-cooled waters-s. Vitrification of biological systems without cryo-protectants is another application that could enable studies to be made of morphology without freezing artefacts and of the mechanism of freezing damage 9 • 10 • When applied to dilute aqueous solutions complete vitrification means the simultaneous matrix isolation of dissolved species. This extends the well known matrix isolation from the gas phase 11 to nonvolatile solutes such as ionic systems or biomolecules and allows, among others, spectroscopic investigations at low temperatures in the dissolved state. Attempts to form vitreous ice by rapid cooling of liquid water have invariably led to formation of ice Ih (ref. 12). (Pryde and Jones 13 did report a heat capacity change of rapidly cooled water at 126 K which they attributed to a glass transition, but could not reproduce this result in subsequent experiments.) We have recently described the complete vitrification of liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions by jet-freezing of aqueous droplets distributed in n-heptane as an emulsion, where the combination of emulsification and high cooling rate was essential for vitrification 14 • We have since increased the cooling rate by orders of magnitude and report here the vitrification of pure liquid water without emulsification by injecting a thin fluid jet of liquid water at high pressures in vacuo into a liquid cryomedium. This is an extension of the jet-freezing method developed by Bachmann and Schmitt for freeze etching 15 • Our technique differs from that of splat-cooling on a cold metal surface by using a liquid cryomedium, and gives for liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions much higher cooling rates 14 • [It has been reported that D.

   abstract = {The formation of planetesimals, the kilometer-sized planetary precursors, is still a puzzling process. Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in proto-planetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We performed laboratory as well as microgravity experiments in which we studied the impact of small fractal aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized dust particles onto solid targets at various velocities. Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force Froll=1.2×10-9 N and for the break-up energy Ebr=1.3×10-15 J (valid for 1.9-μm-diameter SiO2 spheres) are used. Our experimental results suggest that aggregate restructuring in the solar nebula, and hence, the gradual increase of the fractal dimensionality of the dust agglomerates, becomes an important process when the aggregate diameters exceed a few centimeters. Dust aggregates below that size are not expected to be subjected to impact compaction. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {Freeze etching of solute model systems (e.g., glycerol or ferritin solutions) demonstrates that cryofixation can introduce serious artifacts due to the segregation of the dissolved or dispersed material from the solvent. Since, in principle, this problem can be reduced by increasing the cooling rate, a new technique has been developed which combines spray freezing with freeze etching. This spray-freeze-etching is applied by first spraying the specimen into a liquid cryomedium. The frozen droplets are then "glued" together with butyl-benzene to form a regular freeze-etch specimen, while the temperature of the sample is kept at-850C. The results obtained by spray-freeze-etching are far superior to those obtained by standard freezing. Our results, using 5% glycerol as a test specimen, are equivalent to those obtained by the high-pressure method (1). The reduction of segregation during freezing makes freeze etching a method applicable for the investigation of solute systems. Furthermore, the study of unicellular organisms or cellular fractions by freeze etching without the use of antifreeze is made possible. ARTIFACT PROBLEMS IN CRYOFIXATION Since the introduction of freeze etching (2, 3), methods of adequate cryofixation for electronmicroscopic specimens have become of particular concern. In addition to offering an interesting alternative to chemical fixation for the study of cellular material, cryofixation provides practically the only method for the study of solute systems by electron micros-copy. Investigations of frozen-fluid specimens most clearly demonstrate the limits of cryofixation. The commonly available cooling rates are too low to prevent the rearrangement of solutes or particles during freezing. The well-known appearance of freeze-etched glycerol solutions is just one example. When frozen by the standard technique (by dropping a small metal specimen holder with about 1 mm3 of solution into a liquid cryomedium) the glycerol and water separate into two different phases, i.e., compartments of water surrounded by a glycerol network (Fig. 3). For a given cooling rate, the size of the water compartments depends on the glycerol concentration and on the presence of other solute materials. Similar pictures are obtained when freeze-etching aqueous solutions of salts or sugar (4), organic solutions (e.g., benzoic acid in benzene) (5), solutions of large molecules like high polymers (dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone) or proteins (albumin or ferritin) and even suspensions of larger particles (polystyrene latex, 0 < 0.1 jAm), segregate (5). When observed by freeze-etching, all these specimens show a wide network containing the solute material in high concentration and large areas containing mainly the solvent. 2149 Segregation can cause complex patterns, which might lead to misinterpretation of freeze-etched specimens. For instance, suspended particles (ferritin or latex) not only tend to agglomerate , but are often found arranged in a crystal-like pattern. Furthermore, when small particles (e.g., ferritin) and larger ones (polystyrene latex [0 = 0.3 Mum], yeast cells, etc.) are frozen together, the small particles are often observed on the surface of the larger ones, arranged in hexagonal patterns (5). The large objects merely act as mechanical obstacles against which the smaller particles are pushed by the advancing front of the growing ice crystal. Freeze-etching techniques for biological specimens use cryoprotectants that are mainly capable of preventing one very-gross form of segregation, namely, the formation of large ice crystals that cause cell damage. On the other hand, cryoprotectants might introduce artifacts of their own, either be segregation from the aqueous solution during freezing or by their toxic effects on the biological system. In investigations of solutions or colloidal systems, cryoprotectants are of no use at all. Therefore, several attempts have been made to increase the speed of freezing, which is known to improve the quality of a cryofixed electron-microscopic specimen (3, 6-9). When the extent of partitioning of freeze-etched dilute solutions was used as a criterion*, only two methods have demonstrated a significant improvement over the standard technique. One of them is the high-pressure method. Specimens are frozen under a high hydrostatic pressure (2000 atm) with optimum heat transfer. This method makes it possible to reduce the compartment size of 5% glycerol to about 10 nm (1, 10). The necessary freezing conditions can be obtained only with an elaborate apparatus, which is not yet commercially available. To overcome this difficulty, a spray-freezing method was developed, which can be applied to freeze-etching. Since this "spray-freeze-etch" method has previously been described only in a short note (11), the details of the procedure are given in this paper. THE TECHNIQUE OF SPRAY-FREEZE-ETCHING Principles The approach of the spray-freeze-etch technique is to increase the cooling rate by injection of very small droplets of the * It is recommended that different techniques should be evaluated by the use of simple model systems, such as glycerol solutions. Segregation patterns of solutions react very sensitively to changes in freezing conditions and are much easier to reproduce and interpret than freeze-etched cells.},

Such icy material will evolve to become volatile components of planetary systems, such as comets in our solar system. Aims. To investigate the composition and evolution of circumstellar ice around low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), we observed ice absorption bands in the near infrared (NIR) towards eight YSOs ranging from class 0 to class II, among which seven are associated with edge-on disks. Methods. We performed slit-less spectroscopic observations using the grism mode of the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on board AKARI, which enables us to obtain full NIR spectra from 2.5 μm to 5 μm, including the CO 2 band and the blue wing of the H 2O band, which are inaccessible from the ground. We developed procedures to carefully process the spectra of targets with nebulosity. The spectra were fitted with polynomial baselines to derive the absorption spectra. The molecular absorption bands were then fitted with the laboratory database of ice absorption bands, considering the instrumental line profile and the spectral resolution of the grism dispersion element. Results. Towards the class 0-I sources (L1527, IRC-L1041-2, and IRAS 04302), absorption bands of H 2O, CO 2, CO, and XCN are clearly detected. Column density ratios of CO 2 ice and CO ice relative to H 2O ice are 21-28% and 13-46%, respectively. If XCN is OCN -, its column density is as high as 2-6% relative to H 2O ice. The HDO ice feature at 4.1 μm is tentatively detected towards the class 0-I sources and HV Tau. Non-detections of the CH-stretching mode features around 3.5 μm provide upper limits to the CH 3OH abundance of 26% (L1527) and 42% (IRAS 04302) relative to H 2O. We tentatively detect OCS ice absorption towards IRC-L1041-2. Towards class 0-I sources, the detected features should mostly originate in the cold envelope, while CO gas and OCN - could originate in the region close to the protostar, where there are warm temperatures and UV radiation. We detect H 2O ice band towards ASR41 and 2MASSJ 1628137-243139, which are edge-on class II disks. We also detect H 2O ice and CO 2 ice towards HV Tau, HK Tau, and UY Aur, and tentatively detect CO gas features towards HK Tau and UY Aur. © 2012 ESO.},
