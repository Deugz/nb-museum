   abstract = {The cooling efficiencies of various fluids at low temperature were compared by measuring the temperature decay in 3 μl water samples plunged into them. A simple model of cooling was used in order to discuss the results. Liquid ethane was found to produce a cooling rate of 660 K s−1, about twice that of liquid propane, while ethanol was almost as effective as ethane between 273 to 223 K. The heat‐transfer coefficient of liquid ethane was estimated to be between 1500 and 5000 W m−2 K−1, depending on the physical state assumed for the water sample. Samples of flagellated organisms, after being frozen rapidly in the above way, were freeze‐substituted by the method of Barlow & Sleigh (1979). Although this fixation did not give good definition of the microtubules of the flagellar axoneme, it exhibited reasonable tissue preservation in thin sections of the cell body. The fixation method resulted in preserved flagellar wave shapes, which were observed under the light microscope and in critical‐point dried cells examined by scanning and conventional electron microscopy. It was concluded (a) that methods for preserving the wave shape of the flagellum and for preserving its internal structure may not be compatible, and (b) that although the present cooling method (with ethane) approaches the speed required to arrest a flagellar wave, further improvements in the speed of the method are desirable. 1982 Blackwell Science Ltd},

   abstract = {The vitrification of pure liquid water by projecting a thin jet of liquid water at high speed into a liquid cryomedium is reported. The influence of the experimental parameters on the cooling rate and the devitrification of the jet-frozen vitrified material have been investigated. A structural difference between vitrified liquid water and amorphous solid water prepared from the vapour phase is inferred from a comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns. FINDING a method for vitrifying pure liquid water is important for several reasons. The investigation of vitrified liquid water will help to elucidate the structure of liquid water because the effects of thermal and static disorder can be largely separated 1-4. It might help in interpreting the anomalous properties of super-cooled waters-s. Vitrification of biological systems without cryo-protectants is another application that could enable studies to be made of morphology without freezing artefacts and of the mechanism of freezing damage 9 • 10 • When applied to dilute aqueous solutions complete vitrification means the simultaneous matrix isolation of dissolved species. This extends the well known matrix isolation from the gas phase 11 to nonvolatile solutes such as ionic systems or biomolecules and allows, among others, spectroscopic investigations at low temperatures in the dissolved state. Attempts to form vitreous ice by rapid cooling of liquid water have invariably led to formation of ice Ih (ref. 12). (Pryde and Jones 13 did report a heat capacity change of rapidly cooled water at 126 K which they attributed to a glass transition, but could not reproduce this result in subsequent experiments.) We have recently described the complete vitrification of liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions by jet-freezing of aqueous droplets distributed in n-heptane as an emulsion, where the combination of emulsification and high cooling rate was essential for vitrification 14 • We have since increased the cooling rate by orders of magnitude and report here the vitrification of pure liquid water without emulsification by injecting a thin fluid jet of liquid water at high pressures in vacuo into a liquid cryomedium. This is an extension of the jet-freezing method developed by Bachmann and Schmitt for freeze etching 15 • Our technique differs from that of splat-cooling on a cold metal surface by using a liquid cryomedium, and gives for liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions much higher cooling rates 14 • [It has been reported that D.

In contrast, the LFLs of the hydrocarbons increased when the pressure decreased from 1.0 to 0.1 atm, except for methane for which the LFL did not change with pressure. The adiabatic flame temperatures (AFTs) at the obtained LFL concentrations of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were also calculated at subatmospheric pressure conditions. The behaviors of the AFTs of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were similar to those of the LFLs under the influence of low pressures. On average, at initial pressures from 1.0 to 0.1 atm and LFL concentration, the AFT of hydrogen was 730 K, of the alkanes was 1900 K, and of ethylene was 1800 K.

   abstract = {Freeze etching of solute model systems (e.g., glycerol or ferritin solutions) demonstrates that cryofixation can introduce serious artifacts due to the segregation of the dissolved or dispersed material from the solvent. Since, in principle, this problem can be reduced by increasing the cooling rate, a new technique has been developed which combines spray freezing with freeze etching. This spray-freeze-etching is applied by first spraying the specimen into a liquid cryomedium. The frozen droplets are then "glued" together with butyl-benzene to form a regular freeze-etch specimen, while the temperature of the sample is kept at-850C. The results obtained by spray-freeze-etching are far superior to those obtained by standard freezing. Our results, using 5% glycerol as a test specimen, are equivalent to those obtained by the high-pressure method (1). The reduction of segregation during freezing makes freeze etching a method applicable for the investigation of solute systems. Furthermore, the study of unicellular organisms or cellular fractions by freeze etching without the use of antifreeze is made possible. ARTIFACT PROBLEMS IN CRYOFIXATION Since the introduction of freeze etching (2, 3), methods of adequate cryofixation for electronmicroscopic specimens have become of particular concern. In addition to offering an interesting alternative to chemical fixation for the study of cellular material, cryofixation provides practically the only method for the study of solute systems by electron micros-copy. Investigations of frozen-fluid specimens most clearly demonstrate the limits of cryofixation. The commonly available cooling rates are too low to prevent the rearrangement of solutes or particles during freezing. The well-known appearance of freeze-etched glycerol solutions is just one example. When frozen by the standard technique (by dropping a small metal specimen holder with about 1 mm3 of solution into a liquid cryomedium) the glycerol and water separate into two different phases, i.e., compartments of water surrounded by a glycerol network (Fig. 3). For a given cooling rate, the size of the water compartments depends on the glycerol concentration and on the presence of other solute materials. Similar pictures are obtained when freeze-etching aqueous solutions of salts or sugar (4), organic solutions (e.g., benzoic acid in benzene) (5), solutions of large molecules like high polymers (dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone) or proteins (albumin or ferritin) and even suspensions of larger particles (polystyrene latex, 0 < 0.1 jAm), segregate (5). When observed by freeze-etching, all these specimens show a wide network containing the solute material in high concentration and large areas containing mainly the solvent. 2149 Segregation can cause complex patterns, which might lead to misinterpretation of freeze-etched specimens. For instance, suspended particles (ferritin or latex) not only tend to agglomerate , but are often found arranged in a crystal-like pattern. Furthermore, when small particles (e.g., ferritin) and larger ones (polystyrene latex [0 = 0.3 Mum], yeast cells, etc.) are frozen together, the small particles are often observed on the surface of the larger ones, arranged in hexagonal patterns (5). The large objects merely act as mechanical obstacles against which the smaller particles are pushed by the advancing front of the growing ice crystal. Freeze-etching techniques for biological specimens use cryoprotectants that are mainly capable of preventing one very-gross form of segregation, namely, the formation of large ice crystals that cause cell damage. On the other hand, cryoprotectants might introduce artifacts of their own, either be segregation from the aqueous solution during freezing or by their toxic effects on the biological system. In investigations of solutions or colloidal systems, cryoprotectants are of no use at all. Therefore, several attempts have been made to increase the speed of freezing, which is known to improve the quality of a cryofixed electron-microscopic specimen (3, 6-9). When the extent of partitioning of freeze-etched dilute solutions was used as a criterion*, only two methods have demonstrated a significant improvement over the standard technique. One of them is the high-pressure method. Specimens are frozen under a high hydrostatic pressure (2000 atm) with optimum heat transfer. This method makes it possible to reduce the compartment size of 5% glycerol to about 10 nm (1, 10). The necessary freezing conditions can be obtained only with an elaborate apparatus, which is not yet commercially available. To overcome this difficulty, a spray-freezing method was developed, which can be applied to freeze-etching. Since this "spray-freeze-etch" method has previously been described only in a short note (11), the details of the procedure are given in this paper. THE TECHNIQUE OF SPRAY-FREEZE-ETCHING Principles The approach of the spray-freeze-etch technique is to increase the cooling rate by injection of very small droplets of the * It is recommended that different techniques should be evaluated by the use of simple model systems, such as glycerol solutions. Segregation patterns of solutions react very sensitively to changes in freezing conditions and are much easier to reproduce and interpret than freeze-etched cells.},

It has been difficult to explain the efficiency by which dust grains must have agglomerated to form planetesimals in circumstellar disks. A major obstacle is the fragility of aggregates, leading to collisional fragmentation, which makes it difficult for them to grow to, and beyond, meter-sized bodies. The distinct properties of cryogenic (5-100 K) amorphous water ice, which composes or coats the grains in the cooler parts of the nebulae (kJovian distances), may be able to account for the rapid agglomeration. Measurements are presented that show that this ice readily acquires persistent macroscopic electric dipoles, strongly enhancing grain-grain adhesion. In addition, measurements were made showing that vapor-deposited amorphous water ice is also highly mechanically inelastic (%10% rebound). Together these may explain this efficient net sticking and net growth. Similar properties of higher temperature grains may aid agglomeration in the inner regions of the nebulae.},

Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have shown that collisions among the dust aggregates can lead to sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation. However, no systematic study on the collisional outcome of protoplanetary dust has been performed so far, so that a physical model of the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks is still missing. Aims. We intend to map the parameter space for the collisional interaction of arbitrarily porous dust aggregates. This parameter space encompasses the dust-aggregate masses, their porosities and the collision velocity. With such a complete mapping of the collisional outcomes of protoplanetary dust aggregates, it will be possible to follow the collisional evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disk environment. Methods. We use literature data, perform laboratory experiments, and apply simple physical models to get a complete picture of the collisional interaction of protoplanetary dust aggregates. Results. We found four different kinds of sticking, two kinds of bouncing, and three kinds of fragmentation as possible outcomes in collisions among protoplanetary dust aggregates. Our best collision model distinguishes between porous and compact dust. We also differentiate between collisions among similar-sized and different-sized bodies. All in all, eight combinations of porosity and mass ratio can be discerned. For each of these cases, we present a complete collision model for dust-aggregate masses between 10-12and 102g and collision velocities in the range of 10-4$\ldots$ 104cm s-1for arbitrary porosities. This model comprises the collisional outcome, the mass(es) of the resulting aggregate(s) and their porosities. Conclusions. We present the first complete collision model for protoplanetary dust.

   abstract = {Context. The sticking of micron-sized dust particles caused by surface forces within circumstellar disks is the first stage in the production of asteroids and planets. The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions. Aims. We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks. Methods. We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous "phases" and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom & Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles. Results. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10-4during the simulations. Conclusions. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to π 1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles. © ESO, 2010. © 2010 ESO.},

   abstract = {Water ice is one of the most abundant materials in dense molecular clouds and in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials (e.g., silicates), water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have been scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-sized region and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup to grow aggregates composed of μm-sized water-ice particles, which we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at different temperatures between 114K and 260 K. We show with our experiments that for low temperatures (below ∼210 K), μm-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold velocity of 9.6 m s-1, which is approximately 10 times higher than the sticking threshold of μm-sized silica particles. Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities above 15.3 m s-1. A comparison of the experimentally derived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the presence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance the growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.},

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in proto-planetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We performed laboratory as well as microgravity experiments in which we studied the impact of small fractal aggregates consisting of micrometer-sized dust particles onto solid targets at various velocities. Slow bombardment of the target in the laboratory results in the formation of a fluffy dust layer in which gravity-induced compaction is observed. In order to reduce the gravitational aggregate restructuring and, hence, to investigate the collisional behavior of fluffy dust aggregates, we performed additional experiments in the microgravity environment of a drop tower. We observe that the agglomerates are disrupted as long as the impact velocities are above a few meters per second. For slightly lower collision velocities, both sticking to and removal from the target are detected. At even lower velocities, the impinging dust agglomerates are captured by the target with a sticking probability of unity, and a compact dust layer forms. When the impact energies are no longer sufficiently large to allow for agglomerate restructuring, the internal structures of the impacting aggregates are preserved, and we observe the growth of a very porous dust layer. The results of our experiments are in qualitative, but not in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. Full quantitative accordance between computer simulations and experiments can be reached when the recently measured values for the rolling friction force Froll=1.2×10-9 N and for the break-up energy Ebr=1.3×10-15 J (valid for 1.9-μm-diameter SiO2 spheres) are used. Our experimental results suggest that aggregate restructuring in the solar nebula, and hence, the gradual increase of the fractal dimensionality of the dust agglomerates, becomes an important process when the aggregate diameters exceed a few centimeters. Dust aggregates below that size are not expected to be subjected to impact compaction. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {(abridged) In the core accretion scenario for the formation of planetary rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although dust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of interstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular clouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and kilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the formation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can be observed directly in young extrasolar systems. In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks, including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted observational signatures are summarized. We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the initial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence for the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent evidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a brief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size distribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations. The observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models, in particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early growth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks. We also highlight the limits of current models, including the need to slow the radial drift of grains.},

   abstract = {Sintering is a process driven by mass transport that leads to the formation of a sinter neck between neighbouring particles. The temporal growth of the neck area can lead to an increase of the mechanical strength and increased heat conductivity of granular icy surfaces on Solar System bodies. For water ice, sublimation is closely connected to the sinter process, because it drives the mass transport from the particles in contact to their neck region. Here, we report on novel experiments conducted to investigate the sinter and the sublimation processes of micrometre-sized water-ice particles with the help of a cryogenically cooled scanning electron microscope. Based on these experiments, we developed a sinter model based on which the sintering influence on the tensile strength, the compressive strength, and the thermal conductivity of icy surfaces on Solar System objects can be derived. Applied to comets, we find that the sinter process is faster than the typical erosion rates of cometary surfaces, implying that the uppermost icy surface layers are thermally processed. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is warm enough to experience sintering during its lifetime, whereas the sinter time-scale of Saturn's moon Enceladus is longer than the age of our Solar System.},

   abstract = {Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is likely responsible for the diverse chemical compositions of chondrites and rocky planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. We present a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions of planetary building blocks that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it. The chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one where an element condenses when the mid-plane temperature in the disc is lower than the 50 per cent condensation temperature ($\rm T_\{50\}$) of that element and the other where the condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with some systematic differences of ∼10 per cent depending upon the radial distance and an element's condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling time-scale of the dust is of the order of the evolution time-scale of the disc or longer. If the decoupling time-scale is too short, the composition deviates significantly from the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the chemical compositions of chondrites, and ultimately the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, and may constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.},

   abstract = {The terrestrial planets and the asteroids dominant in the inner asteroid belt are water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have decreased below water-condensation level well before the disk was photo-evaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is puzzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be direct condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the Sun more slowly than the gas itself. Thus the gas in the vicinity of the snowline always comes from farther out, where it should have already condensed, and therefore it should be dry. The appearance of ice in a range of heliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial drift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a planet with a mass larger than 20 Earth mass is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because such a planet gives the disk a super-Keplerian rotation just outside of its own orbit. From this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved this threshold mass when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively fossilized the snowline at that location. In fact, even if it cooled later, the disk inside of Jupiter's orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from the outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that planetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in their inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the planetesimal disk at 0.7 AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to explain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its orbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of the phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus, when the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7. AU without being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing planetesimals.},

In this Review, we discuss breakthroughs in geochemistry and theoretical modelling that have advanced understanding of Earth accretion. Theory holds that solar nebula dust particles stuck together to form pebbles, concentrations of which gravitationally collapsed into ∼100-km-sized planetesimals, which in turn accreted to yield planets. Isotopic variations in meteorites indicate that pebbles formed within the first 100 kyr of the Solar System, planetesimals melted and differentiated within a few 100 kyr, and Mars accreted quickly within 5 Myr. Earth’s growth was more protracted, with >98% of its mass being accreted by the time of the Moon-forming Giant Impact at ∼70–120 Myr. Earth is more enriched in s-process nuclides than chondritic meteorites, with a chemical composition affected by condensation, melting and loss. Early volatiles acquired from the nebula largely escaped, with the remnant volatiles being diluted by main-stage Earth accretion, accompanied by loss of nitrogen to the core and/or space. Areas for further research should include assessing mixing during large collisions and investigating the origin of very early mantle isotopic heterogeneities, which might indicate mass transfer from core to mantle over time.},

The water ice absorption is seen toward d121-1925 and d216-0939, while the spectra of d182-316, d183-405, and d218-354 show no water ice feature around 3.1 μm within the detection limits. By comparing the water ice features toward nearby stars, we find that the water ice absorption toward d121-1925 and d216-0939 most likely originates from the foreground material and the surrounding disk, respectively. The angle of the disk inclination is found to be mainly responsible for the difference of the optical depth of the water ice among the five young stars. Our results suggest that there is a critical inclination angle between 65° and 75° for the circumstellar disk where the water ice absorption becomes strong. The average density at the disk surface of d216-0939 was found to be 6.38 × 10-18gcm-3. The water ice absorption band in the d216-0939 disk is remarkable in that the maximum optical depth of the water ice band is at a longer wavelength than detected before. It indicates that the primary carrier of the feature is purely crystallized water ice at the surface of the d216-0939 disk with characteristic size of 0.8 μm, which suggests grain growth.

   abstract = {Moderate-resolution infrared spectra (A/AA ~ 160) from 2.4 to 3.8 /mi have been obtained for a selection of infrared protostars and one object located behind the Taurus dark cloud. The strong absorption at 3.08 /an has already been identified with H 2 0 ice by previous observations. However, we find that a comparison of the shape of this feature with a simple H 2 0 ice model provides constraints on the temperature of the ice-coated grains. For example, the spectra of GL 961, GL 989, Mon R2/IRS 2, and Elias 16 are characteristic of absorption by H 2 0 ice at temperatures lower than ~30 K, while those of BN, Mon R2/IRS 3, and GL 2591 suggest H 2 0 ice temperatures greater than 70 K. In addition, the model shows that absorption which cannot be explained by H 2 0 ice exists on both sides of the 3.08 /un feature. This additional absorption consists of at least three distinct features with maxima near 2.85 /mi, 3.3 /mi, and 3.45 /mi. A common explanation for absorption near 3.4 /mi is a mixture of H 2 0 and NH 3 ices, but higher resolution observations (2/A2 ~ 640) did not detect the N-H stretching vibration of NH 3 near 2.963 /mi in either BN or GL 989. Other explanations , such as hydrated silicates or scattering effects can also be ruled out for the 3.3 and 3.45 /mi features, although they could contribute to the absorption near 2.85 /mi. The most plausible explanation for the 3.3 and 3.45 /¿m features appears to be some form of hydrocarbons, although we cannot identify the features we observe with any other hydrocarbon feature observed astronomically. However, with this explanation, the 3.3 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in aromatic CH subgroups while the 3.45 /mi feature can be attributed to the C-H stretch in CH 3 and CH 2 subgroups. Finally, O-H stretching vibrations seem to provide the most plausible explanation for the 2.85 /mi feature. This could be the result of dilution of the H 2 0 ice by other molecules, where the bonds formed between the H 2 0 and the diluting molecules have shifted the position of the O-H stretching vibration to wavelengths shorter than 3.08 /mi (i.e., the O-H stretch in pure H 2 0 ice).},

Such icy material will evolve to become volatile components of planetary systems, such as comets in our solar system. Aims. To investigate the composition and evolution of circumstellar ice around low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), we observed ice absorption bands in the near infrared (NIR) towards eight YSOs ranging from class 0 to class II, among which seven are associated with edge-on disks. Methods. We performed slit-less spectroscopic observations using the grism mode of the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on board AKARI, which enables us to obtain full NIR spectra from 2.5 μm to 5 μm, including the CO 2 band and the blue wing of the H 2O band, which are inaccessible from the ground. We developed procedures to carefully process the spectra of targets with nebulosity. The spectra were fitted with polynomial baselines to derive the absorption spectra. The molecular absorption bands were then fitted with the laboratory database of ice absorption bands, considering the instrumental line profile and the spectral resolution of the grism dispersion element. Results. Towards the class 0-I sources (L1527, IRC-L1041-2, and IRAS 04302), absorption bands of H 2O, CO 2, CO, and XCN are clearly detected. Column density ratios of CO 2 ice and CO ice relative to H 2O ice are 21-28% and 13-46%, respectively. If XCN is OCN -, its column density is as high as 2-6% relative to H 2O ice. The HDO ice feature at 4.1 μm is tentatively detected towards the class 0-I sources and HV Tau. Non-detections of the CH-stretching mode features around 3.5 μm provide upper limits to the CH 3OH abundance of 26% (L1527) and 42% (IRAS 04302) relative to H 2O. We tentatively detect OCS ice absorption towards IRC-L1041-2. Towards class 0-I sources, the detected features should mostly originate in the cold envelope, while CO gas and OCN - could originate in the region close to the protostar, where there are warm temperatures and UV radiation. We detect H 2O ice band towards ASR41 and 2MASSJ 1628137-243139, which are edge-on class II disks.

In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH 3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN, and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in an H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freezeout levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation, and the formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances is consistent with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

Although disk emission may come from fluffy dust aggregates, the emission has been modeled with compact grains. Aims. We aim to reveal the mass opacity of fluffy aggregates from infrared to millimeter wavelengths with the filling factor ranging from 1 down to $10^\{-4\}$. Methods. We use Mie calculations with an effective medium theory. The monomers are assumed to be 0.1 $\{\rm \mu m\}$ sized grains, which is much shorter than the wavelengths that we focus on. Results. We find that the absorption mass opacity of fluffy aggregates are characterized by the product $a\times f$, where $a$ is the dust radius and $f$ is the filling factor, except for the interference structure. The scattering mass opacity is also characterized by $af$ at short wavelengths while it is higher in more fluffy aggregates at long wavelengths. We also derive the analytic formula of the mass opacity and find that it reproduces the Mie calculations. We also calculate the expected difference of the emission between compact and fluffy aggregates in protoplanetary disks with a simple dust growth and drift model. We find that compact grains and fluffy aggregates can be distinguished by the radial distribution of the opacity index $\beta$. The previous observation of the radial distribution of $\beta$ is consistent with the fluffy case, but more observations are required to distinguish between fluffy or compact. In addition, we find that the scattered light would be another way to distinguish between compact grains and fluffy aggregates.},

Nevertheless, the D/H composition may have been modified to various extents in the nucleus when a comet approaches the Sun and experiences deep physical and chemical modifications in its subsurface. We question here the evolution of the D/H ratio of organic species by proton exchanges with water ice. We experimentally studied the kinetics of D/H exchanges on the ice mixtures H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>OD, H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>ND<inf>2</inf> and D<inf>2</inf>O:HCN. Our results show that fast exchanges occur on the -OH and -NH<inf>2</inf> chemical groups, which are processed through hydrogen bonds exchanges with water and by the molecular mobility triggered by structural changes, such as glass transition or crystallization. D/H exchanges kinetic is best described by a second-order kinetic law with activation energies of 4300±900K and 3300±100K for H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>OD and H<inf>2</inf>O:CD<inf>3</inf>ND<inf>2</inf> ice mixtures, respectively. The corresponding pre-exponential factors ln(A(s<sup>-1</sup>)) are 25±7 and 20±1, respectively. No exchange was observed in the case of HCN trapped in D<inf>2</inf>O ice. These results strongly suggest that upon thermal heating (1) -OH and -NH<inf>2</inf> chemical groups of any organic molecules loose their primordial D/H composition and equilibrate with water ice, (2) HCN does not experience proton transfer and keeps a primordial D/H composition and (3) C-H chemical groups are not isotopically modified.},

The crystallization kinetics was studied at 150 K by following the evolution of the band shape of the OD stretching vibration in HDO doped ASW and HGW samples generated at 14 K, 40 K and 90 K. Comparable rate constants of ∼7 × 10 -4 s -1 were obtained in all cases. However a significant difference was found between the n Avrami parameter of the samples generated at 14 K (n ∼ 1) and that of the rest (n > 2). This result hints at the possible existence of a structurally different form of amorphous ice for very low generation temperatures, already suggested in previous literature works. © 2012 the Owner Societies.},

   abstract = {A snow-line is the region of a protoplanetary disk at which a major volatile, such as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature. Snow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth of ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at temperatures of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks surrounding the pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296 (refs 3, 10), at distances of about 30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a protoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto been seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for solar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency of dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants and the cores of gas giants. Here we report images at 0.03-arcsec resolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of 1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a temporary increase in the accretion rate. We find an intensity break corresponding to an abrupt change in the optical depth at about 42 au, where the elevated disk temperature approaches the condensation point of water, from which we conclude that the outburst has moved the water snow-line. The spectral behaviour across the snow-line confirms recent model predictions: dust fragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth at higher temperatures results in soaring grain number densities and optical depths. As most planetary systems are expected to experience outbursts caused by accretion during their formation, our results imply that highly dynamical water snow-lines must be considered when developing models of disk evolution and planet formation.},

Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation, and settling.},

Important nebula properties and processes that affect the evolution of small solid particles include the nebula temperature and pressure, the generally inward radial drift of particles under gas drag, and nebula gas turbulence. We review these nebula properties and describe how they affect particle evolution, emphasizing the primary accretion stage whereby the first primitive meteorite parent bodies are accumulated. We then turn to chondrite properties and discuss how they constrain the models. We treat physical properties (chondrule and re-fractory inclusion size distributions, fine-grained and coarse-grained accretionary rims, coarse-grained igneous rims), chemical and mineralogical properties (Wark-Lovering rims, redox state, and elemental fractionations), and isotopic compositions (primarily oxygen). We note how currently inferred accretion and melting ages of asteroidal bodies seem to imply that primary accretion of existing 100-km-sized objects was delayed by 1 Myr or more relative to Ca,Al-rich inclusions, and sketch scenarios for primary accretion in a temporally evolving protoplanetary nebula which allows for this hiatus. We advance a new perspective on explaining non-equilibrium mineralogy in terms of evolutionary timescales for small particles across nebula radial thermal gradients, which should be testable using meteoritical data, and present a specific application to Wark-Lovering rims.

   abstract = {Rapid orbital drift of macroscopic dust particles is one of the major obstacles to planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. We re-examine this problem by considering the porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a porosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions, which allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of impact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and instead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation has been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of the high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can evolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than 0.1 g cm-3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show that the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth. This acceleration is a natural consequence of the particles' aerodynamical properties at low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path of the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates are found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10AU (assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model). This suggests that, if collisional fragmentation is truly insignificant, formation of icy planetesimals is possible via direct collisional growth of submicron-sized icy particles. © 2012.

   abstract = {Models and observations suggest that ice-particle aggregation at and beyond the snowline dominates the earliest stages of planet-formation, which therefore is subject to many laboratory studies. However, the pressure-temperature gradients in proto-planetary disks mean that the ices are constantly processed, undergoing phase changes between different solid phases and the gas phase. Open questions remain as to whether the properties of the icy particles themselves dictate collision outcomes and therefore how effectively collision experiments reproduce conditions in pro- toplanetary environments. Previous experiments often yielded apparently contradictory results on collision outcomes, only agreeing in a temperature dependence setting in above $\approx$ 210 K. By exploiting the unique capabilities of the NIMROD neutron scattering instrument, we characterized the bulk and surface structure of icy particles used in collision experiments, and studied how these structures alter as a function of temperature at a constant pressure of around 30 mbar. Our icy grains, formed under liquid nitrogen, undergo changes in the crystalline ice-phase, sublimation, sintering and surface pre-melting as they are heated from 103 to 247 K. An increase in the thickness of the diffuse surface layer from $\approx$ 10 to $\approx$ 30 \{\AA\} ($\approx$ 2.5 to 12 bilayers) proves increased molecular mobility at temperatures above $\approx$ 210 K. As none of the other changes tie-in with the temperature trends in collisional outcomes, we conclude that the surface pre-melting phenomenon plays a key role in collision experiments at these temperatures. Consequently, the pressure-temperature environment, may have a larger influence on collision outcomes than previously thought.},

   abstract = {Context. The formation of planetesimals is often accredited to the collisional sticking of dust grains. The exact process is unknown, as collisions between larger aggregates tend to lead to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking. Recent laboratory experiments have however made great progress in the understanding and mapping of the complex physics involved in dust collisions. Aims. We study the possibility of planetesimal formation using the results of the latest laboratory experiments, particularly by including the fragmentation with mass transfer effect, which might lead to growth even at high impact velocities. Methods. We present a new experimentally and physically motivated dust collision model capable of predicting the outcome of a collision between two particles of arbitrary mass and velocity. The new model includes a natural description of cratering and mass transfer, and provides a smooth transition from equal-to different-sized collisions. It is used together with a continuum dust-size evolution code, which is both fast in terms of execution time and able to resolve the dust at all sizes, allowing for all types of interactions to be studied without biases. Results. For the general dust population, we find that bouncing collisions prevent any growth above millimeter-sizes. However, if a small number of cm-sized particles are introduced, for example by either vertical mixing or radial drift, they can act as a catalyst and start to sweep up the smaller particles. At a distance of 3 AU, 100-m-sized bodies are formed on a timescale of 1 Myr. Conclusions. Direct growth of planetesimals might be a possibility thanks to a combination of the bouncing barrier and the fragmentation with mass transfer effect. The bouncing barrier is here even beneficial, as it prevents the growth of too many large particles that would otherwise only fragment among each other, and creates a reservoir of small particles that can be swept up by larger bodies. However, for this process to work, a few seeds of cm-size or larger have to be introduced. © 2012 ESO.},

It was stated that the minimal temperature of film boiling depended on the body's surface temperature, which was influenced by the body's thermal diffusivity (heat conductivity, heat capacity, density), water temperature and heat transfer rate between the body's surface and the liquid. Bodies with higher density and higher heat capacity (made from copper and steal) accumulated more amount of heat, therefore during the cooling process the film boiling on the surface of such bodies was observed longer. From the other side, higher conductivity of the bodies' made from the copper and aluminum influenced on the more intensive cooling process, consequently the film boiling for those bodies lasted shorter. Low conductivity of the body's material sometimes (in a case of low temperature of water and high heat transfer rate) did not allow transferring sufficient amount of the heat from the internal layers to the surface of the body (steel body). Therefore the film boiling was running longer on the surface of the body which had better conductivity despite less amount of the heat accumulated in it (aluminum body). Body, made from the copper, accumulated bigger amount of the heat than the aluminum body, but cooled down faster due to the higher conductivity and higher thermal diffusivity of the copper. The fast cooling process (copper body) allowed reaching quite low Leidenfrost temperature (350°C) due to the biggest amount of the heat accumulated in it. Furthermore, big amount of the heat accumulated and high conductivity of the copper body determined that the film boiling existed on the body's surface at the lowest water temperature (70 °C). Steel body has low conductivity, therefore steam layer (film boiling) during cooling existed only for the quite high temperature of the body's surface (440 °C and higher). Aluminum body, cooling down in the water at the temperature 99 °C, reached the lowest temperature (320 °C) of the film boiling.},

High density and very high density amorphous ices retain this tetrahedral organization at short range, but show significant differences beyond about 3.1 Å from a typical water oxygen. The first diffraction peak in all structures is seen to be solely a function of the intermolecular organization. The short range connectivity in the two higher density forms is more homogeneous, while the hydrogen site disorder in these forms is greater. The low Q behavior of the structure factors indicates no significant density or concentration fluctuations over the length scale probed.

We investigate the properties of the prestellar core population embedded in the high-mass clump AGAL014.492-00.139, and we study the kinematics at the clump and clump-to-core scales. We have analyzed an extensive data set acquired with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array interferometer. Applying a dendrogram analysis to the Band 7 o‐H 2 D + data, we identified 22 cores. We fitted their average spectra in local thermodinamic equilibrium conditions, and we analyzed their continuum emission at 0.8 mm. The cores have transonic to mildly supersonic turbulence levels and appear to be mostly low-mass, with        M   core   < 30     M   ⊙      . Furthermore, we have analyzed Band 3 observations of the N 2 H + (1–0) transition, which traces the large-scale gas kinematics. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify four main velocity coherent structures, all of which are associated with prestellar and protostellar cores. One of them presents a filament-like structure, and our observations could be consistent with mass accretion toward one of the protostars. In this case, we estimate a mass accretion rate of          M   ̇     acc   ≈ 2 ×   10   − 4       M   ⊙      yr   − 1      . Our results support a clump-fed accretion scenario in the target source.

It contains Herschel's spectacular words-Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel-(-Here truly is a hole in the sky‖). About a hundred years later, Johann Georg Hagen, Director of the Vatican Observatory, presented a spectacular candidate for the ‗hole', discovered in 1857 by Angelo Secchi in Sagittarius and later catalogued by Edward E. Barnard as the dark nebula B 86. Hagen's claim initiated a debate, mainly in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, about the identity of Herschel's ‗object'. Though things could be partly cleared up, unjustified claims still remain. This is mainly due to the fact that original sources were not consulted. A comprehensive study of the curious ‗hole' is presented here. It covers major parts of the epochal astronomical work of William, Caroline and John Herschel. This includes a general study of ‗vacant places', found by William Herschel and others, and the speculations about their nature, eventually leading to the finding that dark nebulae are due to absorbing interstellar matter. Some of the ‗vacant places' could be identified in catalogues of dark nebulae and this leads to a ‗Herschel Catalogue of Dark Nebulae'-the first historic catalogue of its kind.},

   abstract = {The supersolar abundances of volatiles observed in giant planets suggest that a compositional gradient was present at the time of their formation in the protosolar nebula. To explain this gradient, several studies have investigated the radial transport of trace species and the effect of icelines on the abundance profiles of solids and vapors formed in the disk. However, these models only consider the presence of solids in the forms of pure condensates or amorphous ice during the evolution of the protosolar nebula. They usually neglect the possible crystallization and destabilization of clathrates, along with the resulting interplay between the abundance of water and those of these crystalline forms. This study is aimed at pushing this kind of investigation further by considering all possible solid phases together in the protosolar nebula: pure condensates, amorphous ice, and clathrates. To this end, we used a one-dimensional (1D) protoplanetary disk model coupled with modules describing the evolution of trace species in the vapor phase, as well as the dynamics of dust and pebbles. Eleven key species are considered here, including H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S, N$_2$, NH$_3$, Ar, Kr, Xe, and PH$_3$. Two sets of initial conditions are explored for the protosolar nebula. In a first scenario, the disk is initially filled with icy grains in the forms of pure condensates. In this case, we show that clathrates can crystallize and form enrichment peaks up to about ten times the initial abundances at their crystallization lines. In a second scenario, the volatiles were delivered to the protosolar nebula in the forms of amorphous grains. In this case, the presence of clathrates is not possible because there is no available crystalline water ice in their formation region. Enrichment peaks of pure condensates also form beyond the snowline up to about seven times the initial abundances.},

   abstract = {A large fraction of interstellar carbon is locked up in solid grains. The nature, origin and evolution of these grains have been investigated for decades. A combination of observations, models and experiments indicates that carbonaceous dust is mostly made of a mixture of grains composed almost exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. They have different proportions of aliphatic and aromatic structures, and a variable H/C ratio. Their sizes can vary typically between the nm and the hundreds of nm. Carbonaceous grains are largely formed in the envelopes of carbon rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and evolve in the interstellar medium, where they can be transformed or destroyed by the effects of hydrogen atoms, UV radiation, cosmic rays or shock waves from supernovae. Surviving grains eventually enter dense clouds and participate in the cloud collapse leading to star formation, closing thus their lifecycle. Within this general picture, there are doubts and issues that cannot be solved just by observation and modeling and require laboratory work. In this article we provide an overview of the development and present state of the field indicating open problems and debated questions. We stress recent experimental progress in the understanding of dust formation, both in circumstellar envelopes and the cold interstellar medium, and also in the energetic processing of dust analogs, that points to a possible top down chemistry in the diffuse medium, and especially in photon irradiated regions.},

Despite their micrometer-scale dimensions and nanogram masses, it is now possible, primarily as a result of advances in small particle handling techniques and analytical instrumentation, to examine IDPs at close to atomic-scale resolution. The most widely used instruments for IDP studies are presently the analytical electron microscope, synchrotron facilities, and the ion microprobe. These laboratory analytical techniques are providing fundamental insights about IDP origins, mechanisms of formation, and grain processing phenomena that were important in the early solar system and presolar environments. At the same time, laboratory data from IDPs are being compared with astronomical data from dust in comets, circumstellar disks, and the interstellar medium. The direct comparison of grains in the laboratory with grains in astronomical environments is known as 'astromineralogy.'. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Dust particles in the solar system are produced from the small bodies: asteroids, comets, meteoroids and Kuiper belt objects. A further source of dust is provided by the warm interstellar medium that the Sun is currently embedded in and that streams into the solar system. We review the physical properties of solar system dust and trace back its interrelation with the small solar system bodies. Comets contain relatively pristine material that they transport to the inner solar system. The alteration of dust in the vicinity of comets is complex and connected to the gas evolution, but a significant part of the organic dust material survives these alterations. The optical properties of cometary dust are best described with a mixture of silicate and carbon bearing materials. As far as the darkness of the cometary material is concerned, according to recent models, this is not a result of the porosity, but rather of the darkness of the carbon bearing component. This does not contradict the observation of silicate features in the thermal emission brightness of cometary dust, since porous mixtures of silicate and carbon bearing dust can produce the observed polarization and albedo characteristics, as well as the silicate features. The carbon-bearing component is most likely an organic refactory component. The relative contributions of different sources change within the solar system dust cloud and depend as well on the measurement technique considered. In particular, the dust from asteroids, which provides a large component of the dust near Earth orbit, is also preferably seen with most of the detection methods. The majority of dust inward from 1 AU is produced from cometary dust and meteoroids. Dust material evaporation induced by collisions inward from 1 AU produces a minor heavy ion component in the solar wind plasma known as inner source pick-up ions. © 2006 International Astronomical Union.},

   abstract = {EX Lup is a low-mass pre-main sequence star that occasionally shows accretion-related outbursts. Here, we present JWST/MIRI medium resolution spectroscopy obtained for EX Lup fourteen years after its powerful outburst. EX Lup is now in quiescence and displays a Class II spectrum. We detect a forest of emission lines from molecules previously identified in infrared spectra of classical T Tauri disks: H2O, OH, H2, HCN, C2H2, and CO2. The detection of organic molecules demonstrates that they are back after disappearing during the large outburst. Spectral lines from water and OH are for the first time de-blended and will provide a much improved characterization of their distribution and density in the inner disk. The spectrum also shows broad emission bands from warm, sub-micron size amorphous silicate grains at 10 and 18 um. During the outburst, in 2008, crystalline forsterite grains were annealed in the inner disk within 1 au, but their spectral signatures in the 10 um silicate band later disappeared. With JWST we re-discovered these crystals via their 19.0, 20.0, and 23.5 um emission, whose strength implies that the particles are at ~3 au from the star. This suggests that crystalline grains formed in 2008 were transported outwards and now approach the water snowline, where they may be incorporated into planetesimals. Containing several key tracers of planetesimal and planet formation, EX Lup is an ideal laboratory to study the effects of variable luminosity on the planet-forming material and may provide explanation for the observed high crystalline fraction in solar system comets.},

The review goes on to discuss some important efforts in the planet formation modelling community to treat chemical evolution, and, vice versa, efforts in the chemical modelling community to implement more physical effects related to planet formation into the chemical modelling. The aim of this review is both to outline some concepts related to planet formation chemistry, but also to encourage, not just collaboration between the planet formation modelling community and the astrochemical community, but also assistance and guidance from one community to the other. Guidance, regarding which effects, out of many, might be more relevant than others under certain planet formation conditions, and regarding why certain included effects lead to certain important modelling outcomes. As the research fields of exoplanet atmospheres and protoplanetary disks near new frontiers in observational insights with upcoming facilities, developing appropriate modelling frameworks (including physical and chemical effects) is paramount to ultimately enable the linking of a chemically characterised exoplanet atmospheres to its formation history in its natal protoplanetary disk.},

Here we report an analysis of the three-dimensional positions, shapes and motions of dense gas and young stars within 200 pc of the Sun, using new spatial9–11 and dynamical constraints12. We find that nearly all of the star-forming complexes in the solar vicinity lie on the surface of the Local Bubble and that their young stars show outward expansion mainly perpendicular to the bubble’s surface. Tracebacks of these young stars’ motions support a picture in which the origin of the Local Bubble was a burst of stellar birth and then death (supernovae) taking place near the bubble’s centre beginning approximately 14 Myr ago. The expansion of the Local Bubble created by the supernovae swept up the ambient interstellar medium into an extended shell that has now fragmented and collapsed into the most prominent nearby molecular clouds, in turn providing robust observational support for the theory of supernova-driven star formation.},

Two new surveys with iSHELL and the VISIR are combined with previous spectra from the CRIRES to cover parts of multiple rovibrational and rotational bands observable within telluric transmission bands, for a total of ≈160 spectra and 85 disks (30 of which are JWST targets in Cycle 1). The general expectation of a range of regions and excitation conditions traced by infrared water spectra is for the first time supported by the combined kinematics and excitation as spectrally resolved at multiple wavelengths. The main findings from this analysis are: (1) water lines are progressively narrower from the rovibrational bands at 2–9 <italic>μ</italic> m to the rotational lines at 12 <italic>μ</italic> m, and partly match broad and narrow emission components, respectively, as extracted from rovibrational CO spectra; (2) rotation diagrams of resolved water lines from upper-level energies of 4000–9500 K show vertical spread and curvatures indicative of optically thick emission (≈10 <sup>18</sup> cm <sup>−2</sup> ) from a range of excitation temperatures (≈800–1100 K); and (3) the new 5 <italic>μ</italic> m spectra demonstrate that slab model fits to the rotational lines at &gt;10 <italic>μ</italic> m strongly overpredict the rovibrational emission bands at &lt;9 <italic>μ</italic> m, implying vibrational excitation not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

   abstract = {<p> Conditions in the outer protoplanetary disk during solar system formation were thought to be favorable for the formation of amorphous water ice (AWI), a glassy phase of water ice. However, subsequent collisional processing could have shock-crystallized any AWI present. Here we use the iSALE shock physics hydrocode to simulate impacts between large icy bodies at impact velocities relevant to these collisional environments, and then we feed these results into a custom-built AWI crystallization script, to compute how much AWI crystallizes/survives these impact events. We find that impact speeds between icy bodies after planet migration (i.e., between trans-Neptunian objects) are too slow to crystallize any meaningful fraction of AWI. During planet migration, however, the amount of AWI that crystallizes is highly stochastic: relatively little AWI crystallizes at lower impact velocities (less than ∼2 km s <sup>−1</sup> ), yet most AWI present in the bodies (if equally sized) or impactor and impact site (if different sizes) crystallizes at higher impact velocities (greater than ∼4 km s <sup>−1</sup> ). Given that suspected impact speeds during planet migration were ∼2–4 km s <sup>−1</sup> , this suggests that primordial AWI’s ability to survive planet migration is highly stochastic. However, if proto-Edgeworth–Kuiper Belt (proto-EKB) objects and their fragments experienced multiple impact events, nearly all primordial AWI could have crystallized; such a highly collisional proto-EKB during planet migration is consistent with the lack of any unambiguous direct detection of AWI on any icy body. Ultimately, primordial AWI’s survival to the present day depends sensitively on the proto-EKB’s size–frequency distribution, which is currently poorly understood. </p>},

Our sample of disks includes Elias 2-27, WaOph 6 and the sources targeted by the MAPS ALMA Large Program. The set of molecules studied include CO isotopologues in various transitions, HCN, CN, H2CO, HCO+, C2H and c-C3H2. The vertical emitting region is determined directly from the channel maps, implementing accurate masking of the channel emission to recover the vertical location of the emission surface even at large radial distances from the star and for low-SNR lines. The vertical location of the emitting layer is obtained for 4-10 lines in each disk. IM Lup, HD163296 and MWC 480 12CO and 13CO show vertical modulations, which are coincident with dust gaps and kinematical perturbations. We also present estimates of the gas pressure scale height in the disks from the MAPS sample. Compared to physical-chemical models we find good agreement with the vertical location of CO isotopologues. In HD 163296 CN and HCN trace a similar intermediate layer, for the other disks, the UV flux tracers and the vertical profiles of HCN and C2H are lower than predicted in theoretical models. HCN and H2CO show a highly structured vertical profile, possibly indicative of different formation pathways. It is possible to trace the vertical locations of multiple molecular species that trace a wide variety of physical and chemical disk properties. The distribution of CO isotopologues are found at a wide range of vertical heights $z/r = $ 0.5-0.05. Other molecular lines are mostly found at $z/r \leq $0.15. The vertical layering of molecules is in agreement with theory in some systems, but not in all, therefore dedicated chemical-physical models are needed to further study and understand the emission surfaces.},

   abstract = {H2O and OH are readily detected in hydrated minerals in CM chondrites via reflectance spectroscopy due to their characteristic vibration absorptions at infrared wavelengths. Previous spectroscopic work on bulk powdered CM chondrites has shown that spectral parameters, like the wavelength position of the “3 μm absorption feature,” vary systematically with the extent to which the samples have been aqueously altered. However, it is yet unclear how these spectral features may vary across an intact meteorite chip when measured at spatial scales smaller than that of the individual components of the meteorite. Here, we explore the spatial variability of this spectral feature and others on intact CM2 chips which, unlike powders, retain their petrologic and textural characteristics. We also model the modal mineralogy of the bulk meteorite powders and correlate this with key spectral features, demonstrating that microscope Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic mapping provides a powerful, rapid, and non-destructive technique for assessing compositional diversity and variations in water–rock interactions in chondritic planetary materials. In all CM2 chondrites studied here, we find that variations in the position, shape, and strength of the 3 μm absorption feature reveal a single chondrite can exhibit as much spectral variation as the entire suite of CM2 chondrites. The observed variations in the position and shape of the 3 μm feature within individual CM2 chondrite chips suggest a range of alteration products (e.g., Mg-rich to Fe-rich phyllosilicates) are present and record sub-mm scale variations in the amount and/or chemistry of the altering fluids. The samples having experienced the most progressive aqueous alteration show the least amount of variability in features like the 3 μm absorption band minimum position, whereas the least altered samples exhibit the most variability. We also find that the bulk spectral signatures in the least altered samples appear to be biased toward the spectral signatures of clasts versus matrix. By extension, asteroid reflectance spectra exhibiting 3 μm absorption features consistent with those measured here may be interpreted in a similar framework in which the spectrum of what may appear to be the least altered asteroids represents an average that belies the true diversity of mineralogy and chemistry of the body.},

We examined the mass distribution of fragments in the collisional outcomes in a wide range of the mass ratio and the collision velocity between colliding dust aggregates. We derived analytic expressions of the mass distribution of large remnants and small fragments by numerical fitting to the simulation results. Our analytic formulae for masses of the large remnants can reproduce the contribution of mass transfer from a large target to a small projectile, which occurs for a mass ratio of ≳3 and is shown in a previous study. We found that the power-law index of the cumulative mass distribution of the small fragments is independent of the mass ratio and only weakly dependent on the collision velocity. On the other hand, the mass fraction of fragments of individual dust monomers decreases with an increasing total mass of colliding aggregates for a fixed mass ratio. This tendency implies that multiple hierarchical disruptive collisions (i.e., collisions between fragments, and collisions between fragments of fragments) are required for producing a large number of individual dust monomers via collisional fragmentation. Our fragment model suggests that the total geometric cross section integrated over the fragments is estimated to be about the same order as the geometric cross section of the target. </p>},

   abstract = {The latest observation of HL Tau by ALMA revealed spectacular concentric dust rings in its circumstellar disk. We attempt to explain the multiple ring structure as a consequence of aggregate sintering. Sintering is known to reduce the sticking efficiency of dust aggregates and occurs at temperatures slightly below the sublimation point of their constituent material. We here present a dust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust evolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift in a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple species of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile up at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At wavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically thick rings with a spectral slope of $\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering zones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\approx$ 2.3--2.5. The observational features of the sintering and non-sintering zones are consistent with those of the major bright and dark rings found in the HL Tau disk, respectively. Radial pileup and vertical settling occur simultaneously if disk turbulence is weak and if monomers constituting the aggregates are $\sim 1~\{\rm \mu m\}$ in radius. For the radial gas temperature profile of $T = 310(r/1~\{\rm AU\})^\{-0.57\}~\{\rm K\}$, our model perfectly reproduces the brightness temperatures of the optically thick bright rings, and reproduces their orbital distances to an accuracy of $\lesssim$ 30%.},

   abstract = {Several properties of the Solar System, including the wide radial spacing of the giant planets, can be explained if planets radially migrated by exchanging orbital energy and momentum with outer disk planetesimals. Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, in particular, has a strong advocate in the dynamical structure of the Kuiper belt. A dynamical instability is thought to have occurred during the early stages with Jupiter having close encounters with a Neptune-class planet. As a result of the encounters, Jupiter acquired its current orbital eccentricity and jumped inward by a fraction of an astronomical unit, as required for the survival of the terrestrial planets and from asteroid belt constraints. Planetary encounters also contributed to capture of Jupiter Trojans and irregular satellites of the giant planets. Here we discuss the dynamical evolution of the early Solar System with an eye to determining how models of planetary migration/instability can be constrained from its present architecture. Specifically, we review arguments suggesting that the Solar System may have originally contained a third ice giant on a resonant orbit between Saturn and Uranus. This hypothesized planet was presumably ejected into interstellar space during the instability. The Kuiper belt kernel and other dynamical structures in the trans-Neptunian region may provide evidence for the ejected planet. We favor the early version of the instability where Neptune migrated into the outer planetesimal disk within a few tens of millions of years after the dispersal of the protosolar nebula. If so, the planetary migration/instability was not the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment. Mercury's orbit may have been excited during the instability.},

   abstract = {To understand how planetary systems form in the dusty disks around premain-sequence stars, a detailed knowledge of the structure and evolution of these disks is required. Although this is reasonably well understood for the regions of the disk beyond about 1) AU, the structure of these disks inward of 1 AU remains a puzzle. This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner 1 AU of protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging. In this review, we give a rough overview of the history and recent developments in this exciting field of astrophysics. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

   abstract = {Debris disks are tenuous, dust-dominated disks commonly observed around stars over a wide range of ages. Those around main sequence stars are analogous to the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and zodiacal light. The dust in debris disks is believed to be continuously regenerated, originating primarily with collisions of planetesimals. Observations of debris disks provide insight into the evolution of planetary systems; and the composition of dust, comets, and planetesimals outside the Solar System; as well as placing constraints on the orbital architecture and potentially the masses of exoplanets that are not otherwise detectable. This review highlights recent advances in multi-wavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subs highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady-state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

   abstract = {Extraterrestrial materials, including meteorites, interplanetary dust, and spacecraft-returned asteroidal and cometary samples, provide a record of the starting materials and early evolution of the Solar System. We review how laboratory analyses of these materials provide unique information, complementary to astronomical observations, about a wide variety of stellar, interstellar and protoplanetary processes. Presolar stardust grains retain the isotopic compositions of their stellar sources, mainly asymptotic giant branch stars and Type II supernovae. They serve as direct probes of nucleosynthetic and dust formation processes in stars, galactic chemical evolution, and interstellar dust processing. Extinct radioactivities suggest that the Sun's birth environment was decoupled from average galactic nucleosynthesis for some tens to hundreds of Myr but was enriched in short-lived isotopes from massive stellar winds or explosions shortly before or during formation of the Solar System. Radiometric dating of meteorite components tells us about the timing and duration over which solar nebula solids were assembled into the building blocks of the planets. Components of the most primitive meteoritical materials provide further detailed constraints on the formation, processing, and transport of material and associated timescales in the Sun's protoplanetary disk as well as in other forming planetary systems.},
