   abstract = {The cooling efficiencies of various fluids at low temperature were compared by measuring the temperature decay in 3 μl water samples plunged into them. A simple model of cooling was used in order to discuss the results. Liquid ethane was found to produce a cooling rate of 660 K s−1, about twice that of liquid propane, while ethanol was almost as effective as ethane between 273 to 223 K. The heat‐transfer coefficient of liquid ethane was estimated to be between 1500 and 5000 W m−2 K−1, depending on the physical state assumed for the water sample. Samples of flagellated organisms, after being frozen rapidly in the above way, were freeze‐substituted by the method of Barlow & Sleigh (1979). Although this fixation did not give good definition of the microtubules of the flagellar axoneme, it exhibited reasonable tissue preservation in thin sections of the cell body. The fixation method resulted in preserved flagellar wave shapes, which were observed under the light microscope and in critical‐point dried cells examined by scanning and conventional electron microscopy. It was concluded (a) that methods for preserving the wave shape of the flagellum and for preserving its internal structure may not be compatible, and (b) that although the present cooling method (with ethane) approaches the speed required to arrest a flagellar wave, further improvements in the speed of the method are desirable. 1982 Blackwell Science Ltd},

   abstract = {The vitrification of pure liquid water by projecting a thin jet of liquid water at high speed into a liquid cryomedium is reported. The influence of the experimental parameters on the cooling rate and the devitrification of the jet-frozen vitrified material have been investigated. A structural difference between vitrified liquid water and amorphous solid water prepared from the vapour phase is inferred from a comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns. FINDING a method for vitrifying pure liquid water is important for several reasons. The investigation of vitrified liquid water will help to elucidate the structure of liquid water because the effects of thermal and static disorder can be largely separated 1-4. It might help in interpreting the anomalous properties of super-cooled waters-s. Vitrification of biological systems without cryo-protectants is another application that could enable studies to be made of morphology without freezing artefacts and of the mechanism of freezing damage 9 • 10 • When applied to dilute aqueous solutions complete vitrification means the simultaneous matrix isolation of dissolved species. This extends the well known matrix isolation from the gas phase 11 to nonvolatile solutes such as ionic systems or biomolecules and allows, among others, spectroscopic investigations at low temperatures in the dissolved state. Attempts to form vitreous ice by rapid cooling of liquid water have invariably led to formation of ice Ih (ref. 12). (Pryde and Jones 13 did report a heat capacity change of rapidly cooled water at 126 K which they attributed to a glass transition, but could not reproduce this result in subsequent experiments.) We have recently described the complete vitrification of liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions by jet-freezing of aqueous droplets distributed in n-heptane as an emulsion, where the combination of emulsification and high cooling rate was essential for vitrification 14 • We have since increased the cooling rate by orders of magnitude and report here the vitrification of pure liquid water without emulsification by injecting a thin fluid jet of liquid water at high pressures in vacuo into a liquid cryomedium. This is an extension of the jet-freezing method developed by Bachmann and Schmitt for freeze etching 15 • Our technique differs from that of splat-cooling on a cold metal surface by using a liquid cryomedium, and gives for liquid water and dilute aqueous solutions much higher cooling rates 14 • [It has been reported that D. R. Uhlmann has vitrified liquid water by splat-quenching (ref. 16 in our ref. 6). However, to our knowledge no report has appeared since then.]},

In this study, the lower flammability limits (LFLs) of hydrogen-air, methane-air, ethane-air, n-butane-air, and ethylene-air were measured in a closed cylindrical vessel (inner diameter 10.22 cm, length 100 cm) with upward flame propagation, at room temperature (20 C) and initial pressure of 1.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 atm. The LFL of hydrogen initially decreased with pressure from 1.0 to 0.3 atm, and then the LFL increased with the further decrease of pressure. In contrast, the LFLs of the hydrocarbons increased when the pressure decreased from 1.0 to 0.1 atm, except for methane for which the LFL did not change with pressure. The adiabatic flame temperatures (AFTs) at the obtained LFL concentrations of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were also calculated at subatmospheric pressure conditions. The behaviors of the AFTs of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were similar to those of the LFLs under the influence of low pressures. On average, at initial pressures from 1.0 to 0.1 atm and LFL concentration, the AFT of hydrogen was 730 K, of the alkanes was 1900 K, and of ethylene was 1800 K. On the basis of the LFLs and AFTs, the risk/hazard associated with fire/explosion of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons at subatmospheric pressures was also discussed. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The mean value is about 0.32, which is unexpectedly close to corresponding values found previously by others from observations in apparatus with r an order of magnitude larger, for example the value 0.34 found by Coles 9 • Considered alone, this property might thus be deceptive as regards the overall importance of end effects.

   abstract = {Freeze etching of solute model systems (e.g., glycerol or ferritin solutions) demonstrates that cryofixation can introduce serious artifacts due to the segregation of the dissolved or dispersed material from the solvent. Since, in principle, this problem can be reduced by increasing the cooling rate, a new technique has been developed which combines spray freezing with freeze etching. This spray-freeze-etching is applied by first spraying the specimen into a liquid cryomedium. The frozen droplets are then "glued" together with butyl-benzene to form a regular freeze-etch specimen, while the temperature of the sample is kept at-850C. The results obtained by spray-freeze-etching are far superior to those obtained by standard freezing. Our results, using 5% glycerol as a test specimen, are equivalent to those obtained by the high-pressure method (1). The reduction of segregation during freezing makes freeze etching a method applicable for the investigation of solute systems. Furthermore, the study of unicellular organisms or cellular fractions by freeze etching without the use of antifreeze is made possible. ARTIFACT PROBLEMS IN CRYOFIXATION Since the introduction of freeze etching (2, 3), methods of adequate cryofixation for electronmicroscopic specimens have become of particular concern. In addition to offering an interesting alternative to chemical fixation for the study of cellular material, cryofixation provides practically the only method for the study of solute systems by electron micros-copy. Investigations of frozen-fluid specimens most clearly demonstrate the limits of cryofixation. The commonly available cooling rates are too low to prevent the rearrangement of solutes or particles during freezing. The well-known appearance of freeze-etched glycerol solutions is just one example. When frozen by the standard technique (by dropping a small metal specimen holder with about 1 mm3 of solution into a liquid cryomedium) the glycerol and water separate into two different phases, i.e., compartments of water surrounded by a glycerol network (Fig. 3). For a given cooling rate, the size of the water compartments depends on the glycerol concentration and on the presence of other solute materials. Similar pictures are obtained when freeze-etching aqueous solutions of salts or sugar (4), organic solutions (e.g., benzoic acid in benzene) (5), solutions of large molecules like high polymers (dextran or polyvinylpyrrolidone) or proteins (albumin or ferritin) and even suspensions of larger particles (polystyrene latex, 0 < 0.1 jAm), segregate (5). When observed by freeze-etching, all these specimens show a wide network containing the solute material in high concentration and large areas containing mainly the solvent. 2149 Segregation can cause complex patterns, which might lead to misinterpretation of freeze-etched specimens. For instance, suspended particles (ferritin or latex) not only tend to agglomerate , but are often found arranged in a crystal-like pattern. Furthermore, when small particles (e.g., ferritin) and larger ones (polystyrene latex [0 = 0.3 Mum], yeast cells, etc.) are frozen together, the small particles are often observed on the surface of the larger ones, arranged in hexagonal patterns (5). The large objects merely act as mechanical obstacles against which the smaller particles are pushed by the advancing front of the growing ice crystal. Freeze-etching techniques for biological specimens use cryoprotectants that are mainly capable of preventing one very-gross form of segregation, namely, the formation of large ice crystals that cause cell damage. On the other hand, cryoprotectants might introduce artifacts of their own, either be segregation from the aqueous solution during freezing or by their toxic effects on the biological system. In investigations of solutions or colloidal systems, cryoprotectants are of no use at all. Therefore, several attempts have been made to increase the speed of freezing, which is known to improve the quality of a cryofixed electron-microscopic specimen (3, 6-9). When the extent of partitioning of freeze-etched dilute solutions was used as a criterion*, only two methods have demonstrated a significant improvement over the standard technique. One of them is the high-pressure method. Specimens are frozen under a high hydrostatic pressure (2000 atm) with optimum heat transfer. This method makes it possible to reduce the compartment size of 5% glycerol to about 10 nm (1, 10). The necessary freezing conditions can be obtained only with an elaborate apparatus, which is not yet commercially available. To overcome this difficulty, a spray-freezing method was developed, which can be applied to freeze-etching. Since this "spray-freeze-etch" method has previously been described only in a short note (11), the details of the procedure are given in this paper. THE TECHNIQUE OF SPRAY-FREEZE-ETCHING Principles The approach of the spray-freeze-etch technique is to increase the cooling rate by injection of very small droplets of the * It is recommended that different techniques should be evaluated by the use of simple model systems, such as glycerol solutions. Segregation patterns of solutions react very sensitively to changes in freezing conditions and are much easier to reproduce and interpret than freeze-etched cells.},

   abstract = {There is limited time for the dust in the nebula around a newborn star to form planetesimals: in a few million years or less the star's stellar winds will disperse most of the unagglomerated dust. It has been difficult to explain the efficiency by which dust grains must have agglomerated to form planetesimals in circumstellar disks. A major obstacle is the fragility of aggregates, leading to collisional fragmentation, which makes it difficult for them to grow to, and beyond, meter-sized bodies. The distinct properties of cryogenic (5-100 K) amorphous water ice, which composes or coats the grains in the cooler parts of the nebulae (kJovian distances), may be able to account for the rapid agglomeration. Measurements are presented that show that this ice readily acquires persistent macroscopic electric dipoles, strongly enhancing grain-grain adhesion. In addition, measurements were made showing that vapor-deposited amorphous water ice is also highly mechanically inelastic (%10% rebound). Together these may explain this efficient net sticking and net growth. Similar properties of higher temperature grains may aid agglomeration in the inner regions of the nebulae.},
