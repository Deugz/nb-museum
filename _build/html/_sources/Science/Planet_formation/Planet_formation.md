Stars are no different in that respect and their life goes in cycle and the ISM is their ecocystem. </p>

The Big Bang produced all the Hydrogen (as well as Helium and Lithium) present today in the universe. The rest of the elements of the periodic table (called metal by Astronomers), up to iron (Z = 26), has been produced in the center of stars in a process called <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Hydrogen is burned in fusion reaction and heavier elements are produced as the star evolve">nucleosynthesis</span>. However, it is only when the star die in a massive explosion like supernovae, that those heavy elements are ejected throughout the Universe. We are now 14.6 Billion years post Big Bang and at the third generation of stars, galaxies have had time to form and they will be our host for the rest of this discussion. So what are galaxies made of ? Well, a supermassive Black hole at the center and then stars (may be solar systems) as far as our eyes can see, but this would be omitting the major constituent of the

## Star formation

Within **dense core** ...


There is 2 parameters often used to describe the **SED** (Spectral Energy Distribution):
- Spectral index (class I, II, III)
- Bolometric temperature (class 0, I)
However, SEDs are way too complex to be characterised by a single number and their characterisation are inevitably coarse

First stage of planet formation. 
Not detectable in the near infrared.

Protostar begins to emerge and become detectable in the NIR (near Infrared).

Core is dispersing and punctuated by outflows 

SED dominated by FIR


`protostellar disk` to `protoplanetary disk` in 10<sup>4</sup> years (`ref 4 - 5`)
This process involve high temperature but while material is accreted by the star the disk mass and temperature decrease. 



M<sub>Star</sub> > M<sub>Core</sub>


***


Core has dissipated, the star has reached it's final mass and is now contracting. The star is now a Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS - ie T Tauri Star or HerbigAe depending on it's mass).

`Infrared excess` above photosphere, due to a protoplantary disks.

***

Circumstellar disk has very little dust (optically thin) and little if any infrared excess.

SED looks like a stellar photosphere.

### <strong>&#187;  <u>  Spectral Energy Distribution </u></strong>

The Ariane thread of star formation


:::::{div} full-width
::::{grid} 2 

:::{grid-item}

A dusty envelope absorbs the stellar photons.

The dust grains re-emit thermal radiation (isotropically).

This dust emission is absorbed by other grains.

This process is reated until the photons escapes from the core.

Because the (radiative) energy is conserved, the temperature of the surface that  the observer sees is much lower than that of the star and the characteristic wavelength longer ("redder").

Evolution of PPD is dominated by:
- Ongoing `accretion` of material onto the star
- `photoevaporation`
- `dust agglomeration`
- `dynamical interaction` with stellar or galactic environment

#### <strong>Mass</strong>

PPD mass can be constrained by **ALMA measurments** using different methods

**Example**:
- Mass of solids in mm-sized dust grain can be estimated from the `mm flux density` combined with **assumptions** about `optical depth`, `dust opacity` and `disk temperature` (cf ref `12-17`).
- Other methods uses the amplitude and wavelength of the `gravitational instability wiggle` (`ref 18` - **?**)

the mass of PPDs is dominated by gasses (H<sub>2</sub> and He) 

- dust to gas ratio is typically 1:100 - to check for ref



##### Disk component orbital velocity

Orbital gas velocity in PPDs is reduced below the `Keplerian speed` because the negative radial `gas-pressure` gradient (pushing outwards) counteracts the `gravitational pull` of the stars.
Solid materials are not pressure supported and as a result, dust particles should orbit the stars at Keplerian velocity but because they experience a `headwind` from the slower-rotating gas, a `drag force` acts on the particles, slowing them down.
- `Epstein drag law` for particles that are **smaller** than the `mean free path of the gas`
- `Stokes drag law` for particles **bigger** than the `mean free path of the gas`

Different `flow regimes`.


```{note}

What is meant by the **mean free path of the gas**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path)

```

The gas drag acting on dust particles is best described by the **`stopping time`**:

````{margin}

```{figure} Docs/Equation/Stoping_time.svg
---
name: Experiment
width: 200px
---
(a) correspond to Epstein regime, (b) Stokes regime
```

- R particle radius
- pp particle density
- pg gas density
- Cs gas sound speed
 - &lambda; mean free path
 
```` 
 
A common measure of particle sizes in protoplanetary disks is the `Stokes number`, defined as:

````{margin}

```{figure} Docs/Equation/Stokes_number.svg
---
name: Experiment
width: 200px
---
Omega is Keplerian frequency (?)
```

````


Particles with the same Stokes number behave aerodynamically similar. For a fixed value of the mass density of the dust particle, the Stokes number represent the **particle size**. Hence, particles of different sizes obtain different speeds at the same `heliocentric distances`, leading to different `relative velocities` among the solid particles population and hence different collision speeds.  


#### <strong>Snowline</strong>

##### Ices in PPD

**Mekler and Podolak Model**: 
- {cite:p}`Mekler1994` 
- {cite:p}`Podolak1997`

Crystaline / Amorphous

How much of the primordial ices is concerved during class 0/1 phase


###### Where is the snow-line

For water ice, the critical condensation temperature is between 145K (ref 24) and 170K (ref 25) dependant on the **assumed local pressure**

However, snow-line location of different ice species can vary due to several processes in the disk (`ref 26 - 28`)


- {cite:p}`Cieza2016`

### Importance of snowline in Planet formation

- {cite:p}`Zhang2015`

```{tip}

- important for Ross, ie annular substructure can be the result of grain growth
    ie dip appear because no more small grain, replaced by bigger grains -> PPD are not homogeneous

```
