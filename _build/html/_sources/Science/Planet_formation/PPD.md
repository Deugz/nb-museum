Most of the Physics presented above is out of the scope of my work and we will now focus on the Dust Dynamics, and more ?

#### Dust Dynamics

PPD Diagrams comes from Til Birnstiel website - [source](https://www.til-birnstiel.de/#stacks_in_395_page1_myModal)

Different part of SED probes different regions of a PPD
- How to image the midplane ?

Evolution of PPD is dominated by:
- Ongoing `accretion` of material onto the star
- `photoevaporation`
- `dust agglomeration`
- `dynamical interaction` with stellar or galactic environment

#### <strong> &#x2023; &#x2023; Mass</strong>

PPD mass can be constrained by **ALMA measurments** using different methods

**Example**:
- Mass of solids in mm-sized dust grain can be estimated from the `mm flux density` combined with **assumptions** about `optical depth`, `dust opacity` and `disk temperature` (cf ref `12-17`).
- Other methods uses the amplitude and wavelength of the `gravitational instability wiggle` (`ref 18` - **?**)

the mass of PPDs is dominated by gasses (H<sub>2</sub> and He) 

- dust to gas ratio is typically 1:100 - to check for ref


***

- {cite:p}`Desch2007`: Disk model for Solar System, assume compact disk that is photoevaporated, solves problem that “minimum-mass” (assuming that giant planets swept up all material in their feeding zones) disk models have: Uranus and Neptune could not have grown to current size within lifetime of disk. This models derives planet masses within 10 % of actual masses, but only if Uranus and Neptune switched placed in early Solar System (also predicted by Nice model).

##### &#x2023; &#x2023; &#x2023; <strong> Disk component orbital velocity </strong>

Orbital gas velocity in PPDs is reduced below the `Keplerian speed` because the negative radial `gas-pressure` gradient (pushing outwards) counteracts the `gravitational pull` of the stars.
Solid materials are not pressure supported and as a result, dust particles should orbit the stars at Keplerian velocity but because they experience a `headwind` from the slower-rotating gas, a `drag force` acts on the particles, slowing them down.
- `Epstein drag law` for particles that are **smaller** than the `mean free path of the gas`
- `Stokes drag law` for particles **bigger** than the `mean free path of the gas`

Different `flow regimes`.


```{note}

What is meant by the **mean free path of the gas**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path)

```

The gas drag acting on dust particles is best described by the **`stopping time`**:

````{margin}

```{figure} Docs/Equation/Stoping_time.svg

width: 200px

(a) correspond to Epstein regime, (b) Stokes regime
```

- R particle radius
- pp particle density
- pg gas density
- Cs gas sound speed
 - &lambda; mean free path
 
```` 
 
A common measure of particle sizes in protoplanetary disks is the `Stokes number`, defined as:

````{margin}

```{figure} Docs/Equation/Stokes_number.svg
---
name: Experiment
width: 200px
---
Omega is Keplerian frequency (?)
```

````


Particles with the same Stokes number behave aerodynamically similar. For a fixed value of the mass density of the dust particle, the Stokes number represent the **particle size**. Hence, particles of different sizes obtain different speeds at the same `heliocentric distances`, leading to different `relative velocities` among the solid particles population and hence different collision speeds.  


#### <strong> &#x2023; &#x2023; Snowline</strong>

##### Ices in PPD

- [Arxiv May 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02355.pdf): Investigate Edge-on Disks ice inventory

##### Observation

- {cite:p}`Schegerer2010`: spectroscopic detection of crystalline water ice in young stellar object, predominantly small grains (0.1 – 0.3 μm), few large grains, evidence for grain growth, crystallinity increases in upper layers of circumstellar disk, only amorphous grains exist in bipolar envelope, crystallization close to disk atmosphere, where water ice is shielded from hard radiation

***

**Mekler and Podolak Model**: 
- {cite:p}`Mekler1994` 
- {cite:p}`Podolak1997`

Crystaline / Amorphous

How much of the primordial ices is concerved during class 0/1 phase


###### Where is the snow-line

For water ice, the critical condensation temperature is between 145K (ref 24) and 170K (ref 25) dependant on the **assumed local pressure**

However, snow-line location of different ice species can vary due to several processes in the disk (`ref 26 - 28`)


- {cite:p}`Cieza2016`

**Variation from Gaps**: [Article](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/522/3/3378/7134090?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) to extract and put in bib

##### Models

- {cite:p}`Min2010`: modeling H2O snowline in young solar nebula (optically thick), two opposite effects (shielding/viscous heating), snowline position sensitive to dust grain opacity/mass accretion rate of disk, compute abundances of ice/dust, jump in solid surface density at snowline (and where rocky planets formed) smaller than previously assumed


### Importance of snowline in Planet formation

- {cite:p}`Zhang2015`

```{tip}

- important for Ross, ie annular substructure can be the result of grain growth
    ie dip appear because no more small grain, replaced by bigger grains -> PPD are not homogeneous

```

- {cite:p}`Okuzumi2012`

#### C/O ratio

- {cite:p}`Oeberg2011`: C/O ratio regulates chemistry in hot Jupiters, exoplanets show different C/O ratio from solar system, ratio depends on where w.r.t. the different snow lines the giant planets form, between H2O and CO snowline, most of O is present in icy grains. 



#### Water Vapor in PPD

- {cite:p}`Podio2013`: water vapour detected in outer disk, where most water ice reservoirs are stored, Herschel observations, dominated by emission from envelope/outflow, strong UV radiation of parent star irradiates upper disk layer (heating to ≈ 600 K), suggest water delivery to terrestrial planets by impact of icy bodies forming in outer disk

- {cite:p}`Banzatti2023`


#### CO snowline

- {cite:p}`Qi2013`: chemical imaging of CO snowline (TW Hya, solar nebula analogue) with ALMA, observe N2H+, distribution in ring matches predicted position (30 AU) of CO snow line, helps to assess models of solar system
