```{admonition} To Do
:class: note, dropdown

- Insert a small paragraph about how we unveil the history of soloar systems via meteorites and Deuterium fractionation

- Finish this page as best I can and send to Ross for:
    - Comments
    - Ortograph Correction (lol, good luck with that)
    - Check if something can be said about D/H or O<sup>16</sup>/O<sup>18</sup>

- Rework the intro
    - Insert plan
- Make sure that the titles are correct

```

Do all PPDs have rings ? Or is it a certain subset, does it require a bigger / smaller disk ? What proportion of observed PPD via ALMA are homogeneous ?

### <strong>&#x2023;  <u>  Properties </u></strong>


PPD Diagrams comes from Til Birnstiel website - [source](https://www.til-birnstiel.de/#stacks_in_395_page1_myModal)

Different part of SED probes different regions of a PPD
- How to image the midplane ?

Evolution of PPD is dominated by:
- Ongoing `accretion` of material onto the star
- `photoevaporation`
- `dust agglomeration`
- `dynamical interaction` with stellar or galactic environment

#### <strong> &#x2023; &#x2023; Mass</strong>

PPD mass can be constrained by **ALMA measurments** using different methods

**Example**:
- Mass of solids in mm-sized dust grain can be estimated from the `mm flux density` combined with **assumptions** about `optical depth`, `dust opacity` and `disk temperature` (cf ref `12-17`).
- Other methods uses the amplitude and wavelength of the `gravitational instability wiggle` (`ref 18` - **?**)

the mass of PPDs is dominated by gasses (H<sub>2</sub> and He) 

- dust to gas ratio is typically 1:100 - to check for ref



##### &#x2023; &#x2023; &#x2023; <strong> Disk component orbital velocity </strong>

Orbital gas velocity in PPDs is reduced below the `Keplerian speed` because the negative radial `gas-pressure` gradient (pushing outwards) counteracts the `gravitational pull` of the stars.
Solid materials are not pressure supported and as a result, dust particles should orbit the stars at Keplerian velocity but because they experience a `headwind` from the slower-rotating gas, a `drag force` acts on the particles, slowing them down.
- `Epstein drag law` for particles that are **smaller** than the `mean free path of the gas`
- `Stokes drag law` for particles **bigger** than the `mean free path of the gas`

Different `flow regimes`.


```{note}

What is meant by the **mean free path of the gas**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path)

```

The gas drag acting on dust particles is best described by the **`stopping time`**:

- R particle radius

- Cs gas sound speed
 - &lambda; mean free path
 
```` 
 
A common measure of particle sizes in protoplanetary disks is the `Stokes number`, defined as:

````{margin}

Omega is Keplerian frequency (?)
```

````


Particles with the same Stokes number behave aerodynamically similar. For a fixed value of the mass density of the dust particle, the Stokes number represent the **particle size**. Hence, particles of different sizes obtain different speeds at the same `heliocentric distances`, leading to different `relative velocities` among the solid particles population and hence different collision speeds.  


#### <strong> &#x2023; &#x2023; Snowline</strong>

##### Ices in PPD

**Mekler and Podolak Model**: 
- {cite:p}`Mekler1994` 
- {cite:p}`Podolak1997`

Crystaline / Amorphous

How much of the primordial ices is concerved during class 0/1 phase


###### Where is the snow-line

For water ice, the critical condensation temperature is between 145K (ref 24) and 170K (ref 25) dependant on the **assumed local pressure**

However, snow-line location of different ice species can vary due to several processes in the disk (`ref 26 - 28`)


- {cite:p}`Cieza2016`

### Importance of snowline in Planet formation

- {cite:p}`Zhang2015`

```{tip}

- important for Ross, ie annular substructure can be the result of grain growth
    ie dip appear because no more small grain, replaced by bigger grains -> PPD are not homogeneous

```

- {cite:p}`Okuzumi2012`

### Planet formation scenario

- **Core accretion scenario**
