## ASW vs HGW

**Results from Neutron Scattering** 

```{note}

Insert Loerting article with RDF ...

```

- Difference in porosity ... Surface properties are also different



## Production Methods

### Vapor deposition

```{note}

Make links with ASW

```

- {cite:p}`Kuroda1982`: Theory, ice growing from vapour deposition, changes with temperature, -35°C – -4°C, vapour – quasi-liquid – solid mechanism / adhesive growth / 2D nucleation growth, type of surface structure (and thus growth mechanism) depends on surface orientation ({0001} or {1010} face) and temperature, spherical volume diffusion field near {0001} face, cylindrical volume diffusion field near {1010} face, surface diffusion from {0001} to {1010} faces






### High pressure jet freezing

- {cite:p}`Mayer1982`: produce vitrified (=glassy) water in a jet, compare X-ray diffraction patterns to vapour deposited ASW

## Characterisation

### Scattering

- {cite:p}`Bellissent-Funel1992`


### Cryo EM


## Properties


### Glass transition and heat capacity

```{note}

to define

```

- {cite:p}`Hallbrucker1989`: differential scanning calorimetry, 103 – 273 K, thermally reversible glass-liquid transition (Tg = 136 K, activation energy of structural relaxation ≈ 55 kJ/mol, transition width 12 K, increase in heat capacity = 1.6 kJ/mol), liquid water forms from glassy water at 146 K, crystallization near 232 K.
